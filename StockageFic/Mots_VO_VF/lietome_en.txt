roommate and I be just lie in bed this morning think about how nasty hot Nancy Grace be and just try to decide if I be go to come in at all 'cause it be not like there be anyone here to fantasize about no offense take I do not go for married woman Cal Cal Dr Lightman I have the mayor on 2 for you all right Mr Mayor I see of course any time what be it some blowup at the Justice Department about a high school teacher that be kill in Northwest he want we in on it right away since what be that Chocolate pudding who eat pudde at 10 00 in the morning People who like pudde the mayor thank you and Dr Foster for come on short notice this case be a land mine we get a juvenile offender family of devout Jehovah 's witness we get to be real careful here three day ago James Cole 16 year old student at Jackson High murder his teacher Susan McCartney after Mr Cole get into Mrs McCartney 's house he smash her head into a glass coffee table he then be catch flee the house by two patrolman be in custody here ever since so what exactly do the mayor want to find out about the McCartney murder Assistant US Attorneys Hutchinson and Estin the kid be at the scene of the crime he have motive mean and he resist arrest and he fail a polygraph test it be murder one well I guess we be all here then someone who want the truth somebody who want to be right and we the idiot in the middle the US Attorney 's office want to try Cole as an adult but if the mayor be go to support send a 16 year old to prison for the rest of his life he want to be certain we be talk about a premeditate cold blooded murder he want you to provide an independent assessment of intent we will need the crime scene photo and the autopsy report I think you could tell somebody be lie just by look at they the question be never simply ifsomeone be lie it be why look I already tell the police everything okay tell we why you think you be here James I be out for a run and the police think I be run from they so they arrest I I hear you make your school 's track team I didn'tmakeit they do not have tryout what be your good race this year I do not know um probably against Jefferson last week why I run hurdle myself 110 meter how have your quad feel during the race good I guess and what about on your run the night you be arrest I feel fine your teacher Ms McCartney be find dead in her home have you ever be to her house before no I 've never be to her house before Ms McCartney think that you should be hold back a year because she feel you be have some problem with your classmate what I do not want to get hold back how would you feel when you find out she be dead I pray for her soul I can not know God 's plan but I do not kill her hurdle could have run hurdle please so you get a sense of his intent when I ask James about his good race he break eye contact in order to remember and answer truthfully and when I ask he about his run the night of the murder he never break eye contact he be not recall a memory he be lie but I think most people avoid eye contact when they be lie no it be a myth and quite often they make more eye contact they need to watch see if you believe their lie the content analysis would suggest that James have be to Ms McCartney 's house before Question have you ever be to her house Answer no I have never be to her house rigid repetion like that be typical of a lie okay so you will tell the mayor 's office the murder be premeditate look that way but when I ask he about his teacher 's death what we see be this oblique eyebrow Sadness why would he be hide sadness for her look like guilt to I it be possible he do not mean to kill his teacher excuse I could have be an accident okay okay I indulge the mayor 's office in let you talk to the kid but now you be just make wild guess that have no basis in hard evidence this be no accident and personally I think what you do be a joke it be a friggin ' carnival act oh yeah yeah I get that a lot you know a moment ago I see you smile at your colleague flash she a glance then shift your gaze she respond by raise her chin boss reveal deep embarrassment cal I will take another wild guess you two have a fling she do

from his responsibility as a witness do God 's work what do James tell you about Ms McCartney he think she be a good teacher and do you James do not kill that woman he would not take part in wrestle practice gym class because he know the Lord condemn violence even in sport if you value something you build a fence around it to protect it and that be what we do with James we home school he as long as we could to shield he from drug and sex and corruption be that why you be angry about the material she be teach he we be in the world but not of the world and we need to protect our child from nonbeliever be there anything you would not do to protect your son from a nonbeliever watch yourself I be a man of God well I like horse race Manhattans brief not boxer all of which make we equally

over they unholy lifestyle some of they say he be an extremist something go on in that family the police see James run away from the front door of Ms McCartney 's house after the murder maybe he be try to stop his father from kill she what be your content analysis of the mother she be definitely conceal something when I ask she about Ms McCartney she stop use contraction and start refer to she as that woman as in I do not have sexual relation with that woman Ms Lewinsky Distancing language she know something about her she do not want to say we need to look at the polygraph test James fail I

answer the question Zeb I 've never hear of it why it be be allege that you go to this club on Friday night tell I how you spend last Friday evening I go for a swim at the congressional gym then I go home to catch up on some committee read go on I have dinner alone before leave for an event at the Smithsonian get it now just tell it to I backwards what start at the end of the night and work backwards before the event at the Smithsonian I uh well as I tell you I do some reading and uh before that I uh that guy be lie his ass off yes he be when you be lie it be hard to tell a story backwards because there be no real memory of what happen Liars rehearse their story in order they do not think to rehearse they backwards have you ever engage the service of a prostitute I be certainly not go to dignify that with an answer and that be an expression of deep shame this guy religious that be what I do not understand not religious not marry no kid but he show deep shame than politician who 've be catch cheat on their wife yeah be the Ethics Chairman take a lot of the fun out of have sex with hooker but seriously what if he be into something a lot more shameful smacking they around or underage girl I need to restore the expression I have from James 's polygraph up here do you attack Susan McCartney no the same shame expression now punch in on his eye I want to see his pupil they be fully dilate and it be not fear or anger you know what else make pupil dilate Sexual arousal you think there be a sexual relationship between James and Ms McCartney maybe that be what the parent be hide my son do not engage in sexual activity of any kind as I tell you we be here because we believe your son be innocent there be no sign of rape or sexual assault in this crime but on his polygraph James exhibit intense sexual feeling for Ms McCartney Gerald be quiet we see you try to conceal your scorn for Ms McCartney that be not just about the book she be teach be it what can you tell we about your son and her I 've already tell you everything both of you and your son be lie now let I tell you something the only way three people can keep a secret be if two of they be dead so why do not you wake the hell up everything you be do make perfect sense you be afraid for your son Mrs Cole and when we experience fear we try to exercise whatever control we can even if it make thing bad that be why you lie to we before it may help you feel well but it be not help your son because right now the only people who believe James be innocent be in this room I know that you have the courage to move past your fear and tell we the truth wait here we find these hide in James 's room before the police come and search his thing I I know how this must look but our son could not possibly have do this do you know James have be spy on Ms McCartney before you find these no you ever talk to James about sex I talk with he about the urge that young man feel we we read from Colossians together Fornication uncleanness sexual appetite be idolatry he he know there be no great sin I need to see the crime scene photo you can not show these photograph to anyone please we need to show they to your son you take these James and I understand why Ms McCartney do not make you feel anger she make you feel temptation she be a beautiful woman and for the first time in your life you feel desire you take these picture so you could fantasize about her you spy on she for week at school at her home you take these hiding right here behind these tree look through the bay window and on the night of the murder you go back to her house to spy on her and this be what you see there she be you became arouse you give in to temptation I do not know she be dead and I start to have thought unclean thought and I touch myself I swear to God I do not know that she be that she be dead it be not until afterwards I be walk away and I see the blood and I run around to the front and I be go to call 911 but the police come and I run I just run what be I suppose to do the truth I do not kill she I tell what I do what be that you spoon feed he a good defense and he be not stupid he go with it but there be uh still a preponderance of evidence against he More than enough for a grand jury James be tell the truth oh he lie when he say he have never be to Ms McCartney 's house before and these photograph go a long way toward prove premeditation you be not go to reconsider other suspect he be stalk the victim he flee the scene and he fail a polygraph the night of the murder all for the same reason sexual guilt the polygraph only tell you if someone be feel guilty it do not tell you what they be feel guilty about the guilt James feel have nothing to do with the murder look you want to ignore the evidence fine look I hear how thing end for you over at the Pentagon and unless you want the entire Justice Department pick apart every case you work for we too you will leave this one alone there she be hey honey hey Cal sorry I be late have a bunch of work I have to finish before leave why do not you come to dinner with we clear your head for an hour it be go to be a late night

Chairman Zeb Weil reportedly spend more than 82 000 on a single escort over a matter of month he exit his congressional office moment ago be it true that Congressman Weil how long have this be go on look at his disgust yeah but he be not disgusted with himself it be like he be disgusted with the idea of have sex with her well maybe they be not have sex why would a guy spend 82 000 on an escort he

sorry right excuse I what the hell be that I love a man in uniform you know the rape be unplanne one time with no additional violence that suggest a power assertive rapist somebody who be obsess with masculinity who need other to see he as a man if Sergeant Scott fit the profile he would have react to my overture with one emotion disgust there be no disgust just surprise correct eyebrow up jaw down okay but the guy be totally ampe up yeah but he show no deception leakage right no sign of lie he look like he want to throw I across the room a man charge with rape be even more likely to be angry if he be innocent well they can not both be tell the truth they be not Sheila Lake make two mouth shrug when she be describe the rape that be a classic gestural slip it mean she have no confidence in her word the woman be lie I be sexually assaulted you really think a woman would lie about rape unpleasant truth human mortality a moustache on a woman three thing we would all prefer to ignore FBI crime report have find that eight percent of rape allegation be false okay but the army vet I work with at TSA say that sexual assault be a big problem it do not explain the gestural slip Lake 's also not exhibit any of the emotion a rape victim typically display when recount her story no shame no fear we should be see a lot of activity in the forehead but there be not any maybe she be get post traumatic stress emotional numbing might explain her inability to express her feeling but not the mouth shrug look I be tell you there be something off about Sergeant Scott you know I once have actor play out the testimony from a rape case in front of 30 federal judge and you know the big predictor of whether they believe the man or the woman the gender of the judge you think I be say he be guilty 'cause I be a woman I Darwin and 2 000 year of evolutionary biology well I think what Dr Lightman be try to say be that it be important not to let what you bring in the room affect what you see in the room Dr Lightman what be it Harassment report the platoon 's equal opportunity rep just send it over look like it be file anonymously last fall it allege Sergeant Scott surprise woman in the shower and enter their barrack unannounce Hmm back up Lake 's story you know generally it be not a good idea to call your boss an idiot I do not say you be an idi but your buccinator do that be not oh that be a pretty impressive combination of contempt and disgust I be I be s I Apology accept Head back to Fort Meade and check into the personnel file of the woman and the sergeant and hang in there you should consider go a little easy on Torres LIGHTWhy she be all false positive see that be the trouble with natural they do not see what be miss they be all instinct and no science I will have a falafel sandwich please an italian ice Grape you wash your hand today uh yeah of course do you have any kind of pain in your neck uh no why People touch it when they lie it be a classic manipulator you be to the bathroom today cal uh no oh great Anybody else want a side of fece Anybody Side of fece if an alum take I here I would want to play hoop for Carver I bet it make an impression on Earl White why be it guy name White be always black and guy name Black be always white be I go to be sorry you be here Barry White Jack Black do your radical honesty pledge mean you have to say everything you think it be the only way to be truly honest let us turn it off while we be work shall we now what do we know about the booster uh Howard Taft forty five make his money on internet job board lead the funding campaign for Carver 's new athletic center apparently he like give back Mr Taft thank for agree to talk with we always a pleasure to talk Carver basketball Dr Foster hey oh championship ring Sweet must have cost a fortune online actually I uh I earn it ride the pine for the ' 86 team what be that it be a uh voice stress analyz it measure pitch and gauge anxiety we find it be less about what you say than how you say it now tell we about your relationship with Earl White he order I to strip he grab I oh sorry these be Specialist Lake 's platoon mate hi thank for come in I want to conduct individual interview so if you could come with I you two stay here Thanks Heidi pin I down and he assault I I be sexually assaulted you finish the vocal stress analysis on Taft yeah check it out hey oh championship ring Sweet must have cost a fortune online actually I I earn it ride the pine for the ' 86 team typical vocal stress on a typical question that be Taft 's vocal stress baseline and give how irritate most people find you it be a high tolerance baseline he would have to be extremely anxious for his pitch to spike above it so apply the baseline you can see from the spike that Taft have three moment of extreme anxiety let I guess that be when he deny bribe our basketball phenom Yep Indistinguishable to the ear but and no I do not bribe Earl White really I do not give Earl a penny a bribe I barely know the kid thank to the technology we can see the stress in Taft 's voice the datum suggest young Mr White just come into a lot of money but we 've see no uptick in Earl 's spending habit I talk to his friend the guy be get no bling he live in a walk up with his brother he take the bus Earl 's get a big payday come as soon as he turn pro why take Taft 's money if he be not go to spend it the psychology 's inconsistent we need to get inside Earl 's head you want I to pull recent interview footage see if he leak anything when he talk about play for Carver yeah what be that last sound wave always a pleasure to talk Carver basketball Dr Foster that be when Taft meet you see how the graph be all scrunch up it indicate arousal apparently the pine be not the only thing our age jock want to ride hey can I please Staff Sergeant Scott have a past he have a criminal record a long one I think you could not get into the army with a record you can not unless they grant you what be call a moral waiver it use to be just for misdemeanor but the army be so stretch for recruit that they be use they to let felon in Moral waiver the army really have a way with word uh Sergeant Scott be arrest for possession arson assault and battery he have an arson conviction he be 16 but the assault 's more recent no I it be the arson that be significant Arson and rape have an unusually high correlation they be both crime about the assertion of power so with the arson conviction yeah it make the rape a lot more likely we be see promising indicator in the Pentium chip market techspre earning should be strong as ever hey boss call my broker have he dump all my holding in Techspring okay and uh I just speak with Major Harris ' office I tell they you be on your way look at that hand shrug it be not a good time to be invest in Techspring we need to talk about Sergeant Scott oh this be classify how have you get it the same way you would have give the correlation between arson and rape well it be interesting but it be irrelevant I be afraid turn out Lake 's platoon mate have rather a lot to say Heidi say they would not talk about the rape well I do not bring they in to hear they talk I bring they in to watch they listen they turn the video back on huh Yep it be human nature they always flip the switch Hey natural what do you see nothing I do not see anything exactly I do not understand well look the absence of emotion be just as important as the presence of emotion now you you need to learn that when woman listen to a rape victim they believe they reflect certain emotion they blush avert their eye hunch their shoulder these woman exhibit none of that they be not show any reflector so they do not believe she that do not prove anything Lake live with those woman for three year and neither one of they be react they know this rape never happen LIGHTYou make a false accusation against your sergeant that be a crime and then there be the other woman in your platoon you know we have mp stand by if your friend help you plan this they be as guilty as you be right they know you be lie do not they Thought so have the mps arrest her platoon mate they be all in on it no look they have noth they have nothing to do with it it be my idea Sergeant Scott do not rape you no he do not take Specialist Lake into custody how could you do this you know how hard it be for woman in the military the army have just start to take these claim seriously there be victim out there who need help a lot of they you should be ashamed of yourself Ashamed I may have lie but I be do the right thing okay I be try to protect my platoon I be do the right thing I be do the right thing Ladies if you could uh wait in there I will be take you in one at a time play out your favorite fantasy Loker study the psychological influence of uniform on credibility Lightman want to see how they affect people 's ability to spot lie woman in uniform I do love my work how be it go with Lightman uh he be not my big fan well that be just 'cause you be uneducated excuse I well you be a natural the few natural Lightman 's come across have one thing in common no college degree you have not be ask to focus on verbal skill you be say I can not learn the science I be say you do not have to that be get to be irritate for a guy who be spend two decade try to see what you be bear see thank that be very un Loker of you I 've never be with a Latina woman do not push it how be it go with the ballplayer Ballplayers play baseball yeah Chicken dumple oh no never eat meat I can not see no really no you have no idea what be in there take a look at this Earl White just take state for the third time the kid 's on the list of every NBA scout in the country but when ask about play pro ball Chin thrust he be angry very Earl White should be on top of the world why be he secretly angry I spot the liar you be the feeling department follow I I get something for you okay would you lie to right a wrong depend why Lake lie but then say she be protect her platoon I be do the right thing she say it with conviction and with no deception leakage how do accuse your commander of rape protect the platoon that be what I ask myself okay these be the individual interview with her platoon mate watch what happen when they discuss Sergeant Scott Sergeant Scott be a strong leader I be glad Sergeant Scott 's in command conceal disgust yup look the same every time they know he do not rape Sheila Lake but they feel intense disgust for he make I think what if Sheila Lake do not lie about everything what if she lie about the victim but not the crime so you think Sergeant Scott rape someone else in the platoon the harassment report arson conviction both consistent with the profile of a rapist right what if the real victim be too scared to come forward so Lake accuse Sergeant Scott to right a past wrong and to protect the other woman in the platoon do you think Scott rape one of they no none of they be exhibit any fear it could have be someone who be transfer or or kill in combat hey I think we be do with this case no it be possible Sergeant Scott rape someone who use to be in the platoon your buccinator 's play up again it be not I do not say oh oh look now you be embarrassed well you have every reason to be you do get it wrong do not you I mean Sergeant Scott do not rape Sheila Lake cal what she be the one make snide comment look at her face how do people work here Sergeant Scott redeploy within 24 hour I want you to get ahold of military personnel I want the historic roster for the platoon right away get it what oh what now you be start on I do not say something you will regret and I see that can I have a muffin ah no no no

girl could starve do you have something for I yeah um I 've be watch tape of Earl try to understand what be behind the anger uh nothing so far but I do come up with this expression I 've be through the facial code book and there be element of AU four and AU five but it be not anger no it be not can we pull up full stat for Earl over the year sure what emotion be it it be not an emotion and early

they think that Danielle know her killer it be possible that person 's here it be pretty risky to show up at the victim 's memorial it would be suspicious not to especially if they be close you be look at the X 48 or what be leave of it I do not realize NASA still do test flight Shuttle program 's come to a close we be look for the next generation this be suppose to be it now it be 250 million worth of scrap metal tell I about the pilot Commander David Markov he be have an exemplary career Navy pilot flight instructor there be nothing on his record to suggest he would have crash the plane intentionally then what make you think he do Flight telemetry indicate no system malfunction all of a sudden Markov go full throttle flap down he eject just before he dive the plane straight into the ground I do not believe he be just disorient like he be claim do he have some sort of issue with NASA no but we have to consider Markov 's father he be a rocket engineer with the old soviet space agency defect in ' 72 the Russians be develop their own scramjet technology russian spy oh what be next Duran Duran and parachute pant 'cause I dig the ' 80 's it be what we 've get Commander Markov will not admit anything he be suspend pende the outcome of your investigation I be at Angels Ten Zone Five afterburner CAVU and I just lose the bubble oh wow that be so cool but I have no idea what

with this Commander Markov your father come to this country in 1972 he defect from the USSR you think I crash the x 48 on purpose do you I love this country Dr Foster I would give my life for it that be a nice deflection that be a non answer you want to try it again I want to be an astronaut since I be eight year old and I train for the space program every day know that I only have a one in 400

dream well she sure have a lot of good friend yeah Foster do a study once popularity and lie in school you know what she find there be a connection yeah the more popular the kid the well the liar which make I wonder why the queen bee show asymmetrical sadness when she be talk about her dead friend uh when a person 's facial expression be not symmetrical on both side of the face it be likely that they be pretend to feel the emotion from your article in the Journal for Behavioral Science 2001 suck up be really not your strong suit be it that be a good speech um thank but you do not mean a word of it do you what who be you I be Dr Lightman we be help the FBI with their investigation what kind of doctor be you I study people 's lie like the one you tell in there about be Danielle 's good

I get it Whoa Danielle 's name but look at the photo look familiar I do not know what this be it must be some kind of prank by one of my student Danielle 's ID be not steal I think she give it to you why would she do that well so you could take the test for her I I do not have to listen to this Ooh well you might want to try that move again love really it be awful gestural time what do that mean well she voice outrage and then she slam her hand down if she be truly outraged it all would have happen at the same time look we have the essay section of Danielle 's test if you take the test for her we will just match the handwriting to yours do you have any idea how difficult it be to get by on a teacher 's salary how be I ever go to pay off a hundred grand in student loan yeah well you 've get a point there that sound like motive to I no no this be insane I do not know she be dead when I take the test why would I have take it if I kill she maybe she threaten to expose you thing get out of hand so you decide to build yourself an alibi no nothing get out of hand we just we have an argument about what Danielle contact I through e mail but she do not tell I what score she want on the test I can hit any percentile I want it avoid raise too much suspicion but when I ask she she look at I like she do not know what I be talk about I mean she hire I and where exactly be you when you have this argument I be ready to arrest the teacher I would not do that if I be you she have opportunity and motive and she admit to argue with Danielle the day before the murder yeah but I see no

example when you go to see your ex wife and she tell you she be go to get remarry to some rich guy and she do not care how you feel because as far as she be concern you be nothing you 've be replace

to help the governor pardon a murderer the guy kill a cop he start the most vicious latino gang in DC Manny Trillo be the original gangster he be responsible for half the crack trade in DC guy like that do not change not generally no which be why this case be so interesting you have a visitor Lieutenant Governor Goldin I hear he be bring friend hey lambache you go to kiss the governor 's ass again or what ese Pucker up ese Dr Lightman I be Lieutenant Governor Goldin Mr Trillo be on his way the governor really want to make he the poster boy for early release Manny Trillo be up for a Nobel Prize for the antigang work he be do in here we believe he can do even more on the outside well one in every 100 Americans be in prison can understand why the governor want he for a poster boy right GOLDIN of course before we issue any pardon the governor want to make sure Mr Trillo be truly rehabilitate that be why you be here I think you should get he out of there excuse I get he out of there right now get down get down on the ground get down on the ground right now stay down ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ ° ÇãÇé·îÏ× ±¾×öä»½ö¹ © Ñ§Ï ° ½»á÷£¬ñï½ûóãóúéìòµóãí¾ http www ragbear com lie to I µÚ1¼¾µÚ5¼¯ ææàãðü×öä»×é

just say these guy be hero be it the helmet I mean even I like the helmet Dr Foster I be Mike Adams with the National Fire Safety Board hi hi be that for the firefighter who be kill last week yeah Eric Mitchell have less than a year on the job his grandfather serve for 30 year in the 23rd Engine company he stop by almost every day Mr Mitchell these be the people from that firm I be tell you about well I be glad someone be try to find out what really happen to my boy I be sorry about your grandson this just could not have be an accident we be go to do everything we can to figure out what happen Mr Mitchell so that be what it take to get the feds involve grieve relative we investigate any time a firefighter 's kill on the job the building fire be a bad one a two alarm blaze Eric Mitchell and his company go in do a preliminary sweep now Eric come out with a kid then he head back in the company got separate they do not find Eric 's body until they would put out the fire so the fire do not kill he the coroner could not find a cause of death Eric 's burn have no inflame edge he be dead before the fire even get to he it be unusual and it raise the possibility that another firefighter kill he and leave he there to burn I hire you because if someone be lie about what happen in that fire I need to know that will not be easy a firehouse be a behavioral in group they become more cohesive in the face of adversity be that so Chief Morrow Lieutenant Clayton you know that shrink mumbo jumbo will not get you far with our boy that be why I will not be interview the man Dr Lightman will be conduct the interview no no we will get the most deception leakage from these fireman if they be interview by someone that they respect so we will not be ask the question you will name David Caddick and how long have you be a firefighter eight year anything notable well Caddick 's okay but Clayton be bite his lip tug at his ear he be show an increase in manipulator it be a sign of anxiety the lieutenant 's nervous yeah it be normal he be already lose one man last thing he want to do be indict another tell we about the fire our truck Truck 5 respond right away we start search we follow procedure one man on the wall human chain Wall come down scream across the hall suddenly we be all in different direction we split up I be low on oxygen so I clear a couple of room and then I hit the door and I do not see Eric again I get down the hall find an exit I do not see Eric again I check the stairwell I leave the building I do not see Eric again their story be consistent they be can you pull up the response latency analysis Response latency it be the time between when a question be ask and the answer be give tell we about the fire Alarm go off at 3 00 a M CLAYTON tell we about the fire we get the call around 3 00 a m tell we about the fire must have be about 3 00 in the morning FOSTER Response time be under a second if they be lie they would be long right a lot of people think you take long to respond if you be lie but that be just if the lie be spontaneous if a lie be prepare ahead of time you be eager to get it over with so which one of they be lie they all be something happen in that fire and from the look of it every one of they be involve GOLDIN this be the second attempton Manny Trillo 's life this month tension between La Salva and Trillo 's old gang have escalate Trillo 's be speak out a lot of guy want he dead the only thing bad than the street violence we will see if Trillo be kill in prison be the violence we will see if he take over El Punio again the governor believe Trillo 's change he think he could do some real good on the outside but we need to know he be tell the truth that he be not go back to gang life all right More than happy to put my reputation on the line first couple of year here I be angry so I take on the other prisoner I take on the guard I do a lot of solitary get so bad I start steal book from the prison library and carry they around I would not have pick you for a bookworm that much time in the hole I read anything I could got my hand on gardening manual economic textbook spanish poetry there be no cry of pain without at its end an echo of joy Ramón de Campoamor I read that and I do not know I cause so much pain what joy could come from that and then I would realize I have to be the joy that be a charming story would you mind I miss lunch so you be say that you regret what you do all I care about be the power the money and I take a life just the one I ruin the life of many young Latinos kid who could have have a chance do you have any plan you know for after prison I have a plan for street peace we need a social agenda for the barrio I 've be stab twice the last month 15 stitch this morning my life be in your hand I could not agree more do you think it might be helpful to clue I into your little experiment Nope Gang leader like Trillo learn early that respect be key to survival they need to respond to perceive disrespect and it become what we call an emotional trigger he need I to believe that he be reform but when I talk to he with my mouth full this be what we get Nostrils flare Lips tighten Anger he can not control himself Disrespect be still a trigger you be say Trillo have not change not necessarily when he talk about his past he show we something else and I take a life Shame he be truly ashamed for what he be do yeah but the anger trigger no that be a survival trigger and they be really hard to turn off do not mean he have not change you need to compare this to an emotional baseline old video call the governor 's office and see if they have anything they can send over Preferably before someone stick another fork in Mr Trillo yeah no problem you see that you think you make the right call put she on this case well who would not want to be on this case Evolution generally take millennia but change in a lifetime now that be something to see all the natural that we have see they share two trait they be uneducated and and the other trait should have nothing to do with the scientific question of whether a man can evolve yes but psychologically if she have deal with a history of hey if she have strong feeling about Trillo then she have to learn to put they aside oh so I guess if someone be get to teach she how to avoid her feeling then you be the most qualified anything else I can do for you I do need some help with my uh my firefighter well all three fireman show increase manipulator but only two of they show micro expression of fear well take I through the one that do not show fear uh I think we be look for the guy most likely to tell we what happen we be okay Doug Donovan no increase anxiety no notable sign of oh stop it there take it three second back freeze it there Cheeks raise lip corner depress remorse maybe he know something maybe the group be force he to lie well he be the one you want to focus on Monkey with the interview condition keep he with someone he respect use the chief the more guilty the kid feel the more likely he be to tell you what he know training drill 1500 Beecham Drive Truck 5 go go go all right man we have a fire on the second floor asdfasd and do not lose touch of the man in front of you Probie get back in line Wallace take over Probie Probie Probie Chief Morrow what the do not work out like this for Mitchell do it you save the chief why do not you save he you be not the type of guy to leave a man behind hey we know how guilty you feel there must be a good reason you lie come on why will not you tell we what happen I leave he I find he in the fire I be suppose to pull he out the flame have already get to he but I be suppose to pull he out I be just as guilty as those other guy what other guy the one who be haze he accord to Mr Donovan your man have be involve in some pretty extensive hazing he would not say who be involve but it go beyond the silent treatment bake soda shower bottle rocket in the bathroom stall do you know Eric Mitchell have a severe peanut allergy no I do not Donovan hear that slip Mitchell a little PB J be the next big gag well he be junior he be not one of the hazer but that be why he do not pull Eric 's body out he be protect the man he think that they have kill Eric be you aware of what be go on Hazing be as much a part of this life as alarm bell and if one of your man go into anaphylactic shock and die c'est la vie you do not understand but when you be trap inside a burn building you get to know that the other guy be go to put code before cowardice walk through a wall of fire and come get you he be right I need man who be willing to risk their life on a daily basis and Mitchell just do not have it in he so you look the other way he need to learn but make no mistake about it I demand a certain level of respect out of my man there be a line and they would not have cross it then you will not mind if we talk to the other man in the company no Kerry the chief 's niece she will help you out I get real work to do it be like they never leave the frat house you know it be not just frat house Initiation rite can be find in all major culture you be defend these guy hazing can serve an important psychological function oh that be funny I do not remember read any article in the APA journal on swirlie initiation for you MIT mathlete be pretty hard core huh you make fun but you try wake up in a shower stall with a killer hangover and a quart of macaroni salad shove up your what t her self hushing emblem she know something yeah she do and she be hush herself because part of she want to tell I know he be hide a badge La policia siempre asi Shield do not make no difference to I Chota get what he deserve make any headway with the old Trillo video not really no evidence of emotional change at all Trillo do not seem all that different to I let us run the tape I 've be watch video surveillance from before Trillo 's arrest that be good natural habitat that be the good baseline all right let us drop the sound and run it side by side with the video we shoot at the penitentiary Anger Contempt Contempt Trillo 's emotional palette be substantially different back then I be surprised you miss it shock Anger Disgust though that expression be practically default back then the brow lower upper eyelid raise and that glare be the mark of a hostile personality how many of these do Trillo flash in the old video I do not know three or four a minute well he do not show any in our interview not until the burger incident seem like a pretty big change to I whatever well well that be the kind of emotionally detach scientific analysis we value around here I will be sure to pass that on to the governor do you have any idea how much bad the Punio Salva war will be if Trillo get out and take over much much bad I be sure there would be a boom in the crack trade too what if Trillo 's just con we well emotional evidence suggest he be not the same man do you know how many kid in the barrio want the kind of power Trillo have before he go away the guy be pretty good at work the system sure he be Read your Darwin Survival of the fit it be not about be fit it be about be adaptable to change violent people be violent they do not change HEIDI do you see the message from Lieutenant Governor Goldin 's office Nope Holly Sando the widow of the officer Trillo kill have decide to speak to the parole board so she be testify against Trillo 's release no she be speak on his behalf tell Goldin we will be there rough interview I just you know they be just all so tough you know act like nothing 's wrong I mean the last thing they be go to do be talk to a woman I be sorry I I should not be tell you this no it be I understand no it be it be completely inappropriate no I know how they can be I do not think anybody mean to hurt Eric the hazing get pretty bad huh God they would they be go to kill I if they know that I be talk to you right now someone have to there be something you should see no no but what happen on an emergency call when you do not wear your helmet what happen on an emergency call when you do not wear your helmet it be milder than I think it would be loker one of those guy kill Eric Mitchell okay but this just look like a bad joke whoa wait look look at Wallace FOSTER what he be smile yeah sure he be enjoy the joke but uh every time he look directly at Mitchell intense disgust that be more than a bad joke when Manny Trillo kill my husband I I be angry for year I could not even say his name then one day someone tell I about his book I have a morbid curiosity so I go out and buy a copy I read the whole thing in two day I be shock how could that man have write such a I be just everything I have believe it change the way I look at thing Ms Sando do you believe Mr Trillo have change yes yes I do I believe he be repent he be change his heart and he be change mine that be quite a statement yeah of course she do not believe a word she just say do you believe Mr Trillo have change yes yes I do LIGHTMAN there it be slight head shake no now we do this by accident when we do not mean what we say Holly Sando do it every time she say she think Trillo have change and then there be this you can not let he die in this prison there classic glare which be a bit surprising from a true believer in Mr Trillo why then lobby for the release of a man who kill your husband if you do not believe he be change she may be try to convince herself maybe she believe he be change intellectually but she can not quite get there emotionally or maybe Trillo get one of his old buddy to threaten her People always think that anger be the most dangerous emotion but disgust be the language of hatred Hitler talk about the Jews Bin Laden talk about Americans and you during the hazing of Eric Mitchell what do you have against Eric Mitchell the kid make my life hell you 've be with the department for almost a decade how do a probie like Mitchell make your life hell nine year nine year and I never have a problem I mean the occasional bad joke watermelon in the locker but I keep my mouth shut we be not black we be not white we be fireman so we get haze Mitchell gets haze he run to the Vulcans the Black Firefighter Society request a transfer Mitchell make this racial so you have to choose side I try to protect he but he be young and proud he would not learn and the more he push the bad it get so you hop on the fire wagon you find out he have a peanut allergy and you think well that will teach he yeah we do that month ago the kid get hive all over and it be funny as hell but it do not kill he no thing get much bad my guess someone screw with his equipment be not you I would not touch another firefighter 's equipment now I may have hate the kid but I do not want he dead someone do who have the racial problem with Mitchell a lot of guy it could have be any one of they I can not believe Wallace do not come forward early yeah the black firefighter will not rat on the racist it be a little surprising be not it well not really the firehouse be a more important association for Wallace than race and in his mind race be not an issue until Mitchell come along you be say this be Eric 's fault no no this be the new face of racism instead of overt prejudice you see unconscious discrimination Nobody be join the Klan but a lot of people still hire the white guy over the black guy with the same resum and when unconscious racism surface it can be lethal and then what start out as reasonable hazing turn deadly so how do we find the man responsible we would like to run the company through a little experiment as I say early I I 've read his book and I 've see he interview and I really believe that Manny Trillo be a be a change man I ask Holly Sando to come in and she be not up for it so I pull her statement to the press after the parole hear I think it be it be amazing the way he be he be turn himself around she keep flash contempt anger she still hate the guy you may be right Trillo may be threaten her LIGHTMAN no I tell you everything we 've see from Trillo up till now the old videotape the interview everything sugge he be evolve he be not the same man at all do any of the reporter ask she why she decide to testify for Trillo um yeah they do MAN on tape Miss Sando tell I what make you come forward after all these year SANDO I have hear that the governor be consider a pardon and I think well it it it be time eyebrow up pull together Fear there be your answer stop by for lunch no just a question do you get someone to threaten Holly Sando I be not threaten Holly Sando really because that would be your typical gangbanger move right get in touch with your old familiar send she a message look that be not I not anymore you sure you have not call any of your old friend I do not talk to those lacra oh now that be not the truth you see how you be hunch over well we do that when we be lie we try to take up as little space as possible and you really ought to work on that anger trigger mate raise the blood pressure and the heart rate it be not good for you okay the truth be I be in contact with some of they I be work with the gang task force on a truce between Punio and La Salva they tell I to keep it quiet it be dangerous but I have not be send anyone out after Holly Sando I do not believe you he have not change his truce just so that the cop will not notice that he be take over El Punio again Nada es real ni es mentira nothing be real or a lie it all depend on the color of the glass you be look through look there be so much good I can do if you just get I out of here get I out of here and I will prove it to you over the next ten minute you will be show a series of image each image will be follow by a series of adjective if the adjective describe the image click yes if not click no hey Sylvia what be you guy up to we be test for racial bias People with unconscious bias find it easy to associate positive adjective with caucasian face when we shift to an african american face the biased firefighter still associate the adjective with the image it just take they long clock the racist oh they be all racist yeah 80 of people who take this test be bias we be just look for the the guy who take the long FOSTER oh they be just about do all right can we uh pull up the average association time for each of they LOKER it be take David Caddick three time as long to say nice thing about African Americans look like we have a winner I be not a racist FOSTER no you do not think you be but it would explain why you take such an active role in the hazing I do not do anything different than the other guy you do not mess with Eric Mitchell 's equipment I do not have a problem with Mitchell we know that you hate he you do not even realize how much you hate he how much you hate all of they I be tell you that I do not have any kind of a racial problem with Mitchell but you have another problem with he the guy could not keep it in his pant this be about a girl you see the disgust yeah well that be hate I be guess it be racially motivate be that your problem be it that he be black and she be white I do not know Eric be date a white girl be that why this happen well we be not sure racial hatred be about disgust but when we press Caddick about the girl the predominant emotion be anger which suggest that Eric may have cross some other line that maybe Caddick be angry because he disrespect his code by date a white girl that be not part of any code that I remember well we do not think this be just any white girl might have be anothe firefighter 's girl he know well he be smart than that do he ever bring anyone home from the firehouse oh God she come by after Eric die she be upset she bring I a meal do you remember her name Kerry the chief 's niece should I call DC Gang Task Force Ask if they 've hear of a threat against Holly Sando Nope Trillo do not show any deception leakage not when he deny threaten Sando not when be talk about the truce he be a criminal he be a fantastic liar he be an appalling liar he be atrocious the one time he do lie he be completely transparent you should 've see that so you think he be tell the truth I do not think he be go back to the gang then why be Holly Sando lie if Trillo be not threaten she why be she lie for he well I do not know could be any number of reason yeah but there be not any man you need to listen to I you see his anger you know this guy be violent you need you need to listen to I you need to stop make this personal I be not make this personal yeah you be your procerus do not move which mean you have your nose fix right you do not strike I as particularly vain so so what be it then who be it be it your dad your dad smack you around I know violent people they do not change you say so yourself once people learn this kind of trigger who be you call I think you might be right in a way put I through to Lieutenant Governor Goldin please I think you should go ahead and announce Trillo 's release let he go yeah just one thing though I have I meet Eric on his first day he be so excited he move here from DC and he do not know anyone so I I offer to take he out I be be friendly and and six month later he ask I to marry he your relationship it be a secret it have to be work in the house it be like have a dozen overprotective brother and my uncle he he do not know he would not let I date a fireman not not one in his house that be why Eric put in for a transfer I think that if we make a clean break we be go to move to a little town outside of Philly he want a family Jack I have no idea I have no idea that they be in a relationship that be true loker Apologies I take the liberty of tape your reaction just now when your niece start describe her relationship and six month later he ask I to marry he Surprise so this have nothing to do with Mitchell 's murder FOSTER it do Eric Mitchell be kill because he step out of line he sleep with the chief 's niece he disrespect the code now the chief set the rule but he do not enforce they that be somebody else 's job I tape you too and six month later he ask I to marry he Anger and disgust the language of hate you you kill he no I do not I just want to humiliate he he need to learn humility he be one of our man no he be not one of my man my man respect the code my man do not complain when they be force to broom the latrine and my man know damn well not to crap where they eat for God 's sake Tommy you kill a man arrest he I be just follow the code Holly Sando hi what have you get there a 38 38 special Police say you register that a couple of month ago long enough to figure out

Ribocore Pharmaceutical be that one of the company that throw money at you I only take their money if I believe in they BUCHANAN Erica be a student of mine at Georgetown she be one of the good guy six week ago someone break into the Ribocore labs steal the formula for Priox it be their new insulin pill recently a cheap knockoff version hit the market and it be kill people Cal Drew Coleman be the third case we 've find they all take the knockoff Priox be a complicated compound run the formula the wrong way and the side effect can be lethal well why do not you just call in the FDA FDA investigation would take month our IT guy say the datum theft be an inside job only three chemist have lab access they be all deny they be involve if you could tell we who be lie we can find out who be make the knockoff and shut they down if we do not get this counterfeit drug off the market soon we be look at hundred of death okay the Ribocore theft take place at 2 27 a m in test lab 290 now one of you disable the scanner so it could not identify your key card you know I be a chemist not an engineer I be not even in the building that night now you manage to avoid the security camera you know this be ridiculous I 've work for Ribocorp for 15 year but one of you when you download the Priox formula leave your fingerprint on the data port well you can check mine uh come on I use that computer all the time so do I I mean you can not possibly think no I can not so you two can go so why would you steal the Priox formula I do not go ahead check my fingerprint you do not leave any I make that up what be you talk about the thief wear glove but you know that do not you that be why you leapt at the chance to prove your innocence only a guilty person would know that a fingerprint could not possibly be theirs all right call Vandeman and tell she we find who steal the information it be not what you think no see it be not what you think that formula you sell your knockoff Priox it be kill people you be wrong I do not break in to the lab to steal the formula why then two month ago I come across a lab study that say stroke be a possible Priox side effect Vandeman have bury the full report but it be in the database in testing lab 290 I be try to build a case against the drug the problem be not knockoff Priox it be the real drug that be the killer this be new I ask Grace not to let anybody back here I be go on Larry King to talk up the new flu vaccine so this be just you know save time do your missus know how much you spend on makeup chuckle no and unless you want Larry King to know how you get drunk and talk your way past White House security never happen oh that never happen well this never happen either I need to talk to you about Erica Vandeman Derek just uh give we a second thank you find out who break into the lab and steal the formula the chemist who break into the lab be not after the formula really early stage testing on Priox blood clotting lead to stroke what this chemist be pretend to be some kind of a whistle blower her study say that the real drug be the killer Cal it do not make sense why would Erica hire you damage control you hire we and you spin this into a story about a counterfeit drug no not Erica I mean if she think this drug be kill people she would be first to pull it off the market well the chemist do not appear to be lie and the study indicate indicate what what do it indicate it indicate nothing maybe the lab be careless maybe they make a mistake so you think I should talk to they cal I have know Erica Vandeman for year and

give we Aisha Ward and a good evening to you sir you go straight to Vandeman you do not even bother to call well cal I do not realize we be go steady but I do try you at your office hey there be serious question here I stop investigate cal you be not hire to investigate Ribocore you be hire to investigate who break into their lab the drug 's kill people I have six lab report on Priox include a 9 000 person study Priox do not cause stroke in any of they only the knockoff do that Ribocore 's issue a warning and they be work with police to find the distributor you read through this study Vandeman walk I through they yes oh really she also show I this the police do a little more dig Aisha Ward have 500 000 wire into her saving account from an offshore bank just before the break in that would be four time her annual salary she steal the formula Cal she steal it she sell it now she be try to cover it up I be not easily fool Jeffrey I know that make you one hell of li what do you want well I love be dupe do not happen often but you know I be intrigue so we can either chitchat or you can tell we the truth I give you the truth and you run right back to Vandeman you be incredible you be incredible you be incredible you know it be not hard to find a good liar but a truly great one that be rare I be not lie well your bank statement say you be 500 grand wire to your account now that sound about right for the formula to a billion dollar drug so who do you sell it to do not matter oh so you admit it you sell the formula sure I sell it but I do not need to break into the lab for that I know the formula by heart I sell it month before the break in so why break into the lab at all I tell you I find the summary for the mouse study I want the full report Mouse study be an outlier just one bad test do you talk to Neeman Labs that study be evidence that Priox be a killer yes I sell the formula but then I find the study and it tear at my conscience I have to do something so first corporate thief then whistle blower that be what you want we to believe right please someone have to get Priox off the market and the knockoff I sell be the same as the real thing and the real thing be kill people go to Neeman Labs they will tell you thank for see we at such short notice Dr Dembeck uh no problem it be uh it be a light day oh very light LIGHTMAN want to ask you a couple of question about um some testingyou do on a drug call Priox uh I have nothing to say why be that 'cause you botch the test Anger 's real no shame no guilt maybe Ribocore do not like what they get back in the report so what do they uh just drop you as a client then they fire we okay they blackball we and give the drug to a lab that would give they the result that they want that would test it into compliance and then after that there be no more testing Priox yeah no but I have hear rumor about some of the other study you know I get into this business to do cut edge research to try to help people apparently science and business just do not mix have you see Dr Lightman he go down to the hospital DC General what for our Priox victim Drew Coleman he have another stroke he be be take off life support oh my God that be not all I find anecdotal evidence online two more stroke case link to Priox both victim young both in good physical shape that be still not go to be enough to get it pull off the market I will be right back hey Torres tell I you be here be everything okay well for Mr Coleman it be not maybe Aisha Ward be right you do not have to do this if you want to choose your friendship first you can just hand this over to the authority let somebody else investigate it yeah I be sure they would do a bang up job I be just say that you can walk away what if the drug really be kill people come on I need to show you something back at work I be so sorry for my action I be deeply deeply sorry so like I tell you we think the State Department 's more interested in get his sister out there be nothing noteworthy here yeah but check out Nicole I also apologize and beg forgiveness at first we think it be just sleep deprivation but she do not look fatigued no slouch no lean I mean I guess that could be adrenaline no she be not sleep deprive she be slur her word intentionally the US should leave Iraq now Saddam Hussein be a great leader I do not understand who be this soldier he be an american POW from the first Gulf War but what be relevant here be that he be use the same speech pattern in his confession that your daughter do it be a code the army teach soldier to slur their word if capture or force to give a confession the enemy can not hear the difference but it signal that they have not break you it be part of the military Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape training military training neither of our child have any military training the State Department file do not mention any I be sorry what be you say diane please do not do that Robert you 've be tell I to be calm this whole time now Marcus be a poetry major for God 's sake what about your daughter this be a joke Mr Bradin to my knowledge Nicole 's never be involve with the military to my knowledge be you tell we everything Robert Mr Bradin I can not be effective without all the information I can not give you all the information Robert what be you talk about I can not tell you I be not suppose to know I would be break the law she be US intelligence what the hell be you think uh excuse I our firm have a reputation for discretion you have secret you tell we otherwise we can not do our job I still do not know what you be talk about you know exactly what I be talk about Nicole Bradin be a spy how be I suppose to tell you that it be classified information get a lot of people kill include Nicole I wish I have know that early yeah well maybe now you will understand why I be take the deal wait what deal rafik call an hour ago he be offer to hand over one of the prisoner in exchange for their humanitarian demand we be get Nicole back we will do what we can for Marcus no that be a terrible call it will tear the family apart Nicole will never be able to live with herself okay do you understand that woman know the address to every CIA safehouse in the Middle East and you be worried about her feeling Rafik 's demand patriot missile for Marcus so it be a nonstarter we be do here I be get Nicole back home before the Yemenis find out who she be and that be it Dr Foster Mr Bradin what be you do here the uh State Department have not be return my call I do not know where else to go this be Ms McDermott from the Red Cross one of their nurse be allow to visit Marcus yesterday and she manage to get these photo out what happen apparently he try to escape the yemeni guard beat he severely he have break rib and a concussion he have not be allow to see a doctor our nurse demand that Marcus be transfer to a medical facility for treatment she be tell there be no point in treat he Marcus be go to be sentence tomorrow and then they be go to execute he they be go to shoot my son please you got to get he out you need to raise the acidity if you want it to act as a compound oh scientist and a businesswoman no wonder Jeffrey be such an advocate Dr Lightman Ms torre this be a pleasant surprise I be sorry about the unexpected pop in but I find the more time one have to prepare a lie the hard it be for I to spot okay would you excuse we for a moment so what can I do for you oh well um some of the pharmaceutical journal find out that I be involve in the case and they uh call with a couple question so I think I would just run a few thing by you Sure appreciate that uh well first then the real Priox versus the knockoff drug what exactly be the difference well it be complicated it have to do with the way that you run the compound all right well try I I be quite a chemist back in Oxford there be certain proprietary information why do not you have the journal refer to I on that one okay how about the mouse study Ms Ward keep mention there be nothing to it no other Priox testing show any side effect and all these lab be on the up and up right I be intimately involved with every one of those company I trust they all oh well that be good 'cause it be quite hard to find a company one can trust these day right so she bite her lip every time I go at her incredibly anxious I do not know how we miss it early well lie detection 's all about ask the right question Shame they be pay top dollar too you call reporter no make they up uh Vandeman will be try to track they down which will buy we a little time Time for what Heidi yeah can you make an appointment with uh Jim Gunderson of the FDA tell he it be urgent yeah I be on my way back it be mouse Cal it be one study yeah well Vandeman 's lie about the other test well even if you be right there be not enough here to pull Priox off the market I can start investigation but I can not do more than that FDA investigation take month a lot of people could die Jim well if you can prove that Vandeman manipulate the Priox testing I will recall the drug immediately but without more hard datum my hand be tie all right well uh do you mind if I use your name throw it around see if I can open a few door you should start with your friend Buchanan he be a drive force behind the drug 's approval Buchanan push the drug yeah I can show you about a dozen letter he submit on behalf of Priox you do know he be on the Ribocore payroll he be not involve in this Jeffrey encourage I to come and talk to you I mean he be as eager to get to the bottom of this as we be Jeffrey encourage I to come see you all right the wall at the FDA have ear yeah well then I be sure they can tell you be lie too hey if Jeffrey know what be go on he would have come to the FDA himself the guy be on the payroll he push the drug through FDA approval you can not really believe that you know if it be someone in your family all right how much proof would you need before you hang they out I look if Jeffrey know about Priox he be go to jail but I be go to be damn sure before I send he there all right okay Good I think you say Peters be make the deal just because he be do do not mean we be he be almost comical with the sound off I be try to concentrate here well he be get the good posture I 've ever see he look like Mussolini he be try to make himself look big men gorilla blowfish you know when they want to appear dominant they puff themselves up this guy be definitely compensate for something maybe you be on to something rafik really care about appearance he want to look like a leader that could be our leverage hey I think I hear you come back in where 's torre I send she off to talk to lab that test Priox you know Jeffrey always love the limelight can not tell you how many time I would come home switch to the news and there he be in my living room push some new drug or other cal Merry go round of government business and medium enough money and fame to make head spin I suppose do you really think Jeffrey 's guilty I do not know I do not know you know when my mother die Jeffrey take the train back to London with I I would only know he for about a month but he skip out of college and come with I just to keep I company so honestly I do not know hey I 've get something you should see so I go to all six Priox testing lab I do not get anything until I talk to the researcher at the lab that do the 9 000 person study he show sign of deception leakage yeah he look like he be about to hurl so I come back and pull a video of Vandeman talk about that study Priox promise to help the million live with diabetes an intensive 9 000 person study same lip bite she do it every time she talk about that study and give the depth and the breadth of this 9 000 person study just like today she be totally freak out she be not the only one what he be just stare at the floor yeah watch he look at she when she be talk about the study and then catch her eye and then look down and away sign of Guilt yeah I be sorry yeah I too where do you dig this up I still remember you bound into morning lab

intention of pay the money back in a couple of good quarter I be not steal anything you mean you be not steal anything that be what I say do you hear he change verb tense every time he talk about whether there be any money leave he keep shift from the past to the present and then back again yeah it be a sign of lie but it do not change the fact that he be go to go to a country club prison for five year and he be never go to give up the money Mr Hollin be die he be not go to make it two year in the prison health system maybe he be protect his daughter 's inheritance okay but he be still not go to tell we where the money be but if he be save the money for his daughter then she must know something about how to access it okay so what we we get back in with the devil spawn and we see what she know the devil spawn what be with you on this one this pompous douchebag fly around the country in his private jet he get people to give he their hard earn money he steal it and then they act like we be persecute he I be talk to the daughter alone what why if she keep sense how much you hate her father we will get nothing hey where be we on video I 've get Rajal on video on the subway platform

record she tell the professor she be fine and you 've be feel well every day much well no one could see she be actually in agony Lightman finally get the idea to slow down the film and that be when he see the agony on her face that be what lead he to discover microexpression in the first place well I I hope they do not let that woman off the psych ward well she get a pass home for the weekend and kill herself they do not know to look for microexpression then nobody know they exist it be sad how my father 's become the scapegoat for this country 's problem he do not cause the recession no he do not he be one man who make a mistake now it be go to haunt our family forever you work right by his side I be sure you be upset he lie to you too I know what it be like to be disappoint by a father Mine drink his way through my childhood and then spend the rest of his life try to make it up to I do not try to analyze I or my father you do not know anything about we he be still hide some of the money for you and your child be not he of course not you be tell the truth so what be he hide nothing but no one will believe he they want to crucify he they call he the Hitler of Wall Street nothing good can ever happen to our family now it be be a horror Carolyn use negative emotion word every time she speak Hell scapegoat haunt Hitler worthless crucify all psychological indicator of a guilty conscience but she show no sign of lie when she say her father be not hide the money for they no she do not what if she be hide the money the SEC clear she but only because her father take the blame maybe he be take the blame for everything to hide whatever part his daughter have in the scheme I just figure that if his daughter be guilty a man like Hollin would not hesitate to eat his young look at a man like he be the devil and you will never understand his motive well everyone know he be a liar then we listen to he lie here be the article for Carolyn Hollin and her father thank now get back to help Lightman whatever he need uh this suicide thing what about it well I see he watch the film of that woman Louise Mason and Loker tell I how she be a patient of Lightman 's professor yeah I see he look at she and he show guilt all over his face just because you can see everything do not mean you understand it I do not think she be his professor 's patient I think she be his patient what if he be the one who who do not see it and let she off the psych ward leave it alone hey you okay yeah I be good hey I just figure you would be work late so I bring your favorite Pad Thai Nice you know I

rescue uh these two man be show joy and relief yeah freeze there can we push in on this man okay lip stretch can you pan up to the eye Eyelids retract fear that be conceal fear well he be bury under 50 ton of concrete and steel what the hell be you expect Relief I do not expect a man who be just be tell he be go to be rescue to show fear and everyone else be show relief maybe he do not believe he can be rescue Post traumatic stress can stifle almost any positive emotion maybe uh Mr Blunt do not want to be rescue who would not want to be rescue someone who cause the collapse in the first place you think Blunt might 've intentionally cause the collapse well that would explain the look of fear good explanation we 've get this be unbelievable how long have Jered Blunt work for you Mr Warren about six month any problem do he threaten violence against the company yeah he confront I a few time in fact he send a threatening letter to my office complain about overtime why do not you fire he well believe I I try the union block why would blunt sabotage the building while he be still inside it well maybe he got trap down there can you replay the video again okay we be up we be all bang up a little but we be okay and I love you Valerie wait freeze it freeze it look at that there be char on the concrete Burn mark from an explosion Damn what be wrong Blunt could have use explosive to try to blow up the building that could have cause the collapse if he do this he could be try to sabotage our rescue effort too there could be more explosive down there what about my other guy we need to get they out of there they be trap right here in the Northwest Quadrant if they can get across to the elevator shaft here they would be protect from another explosion no way this floor 's too unstable to get there they would never make it we be get ready to send rescue worker down there if there be undetonate explosive I can not move forward Dr Lightman can you find out from Blunt if he do this so we know if it be safe to get these man down there if you get the live feed back up I can talk to he directly we have to get it back up then we will not get anything from Blunt that way he be not go to admit to blow up the building when he be still down there with his crew then what the hell be we go to do 'cause we be just waste time here and Kisker 's down there bleed Violence in the workplace correlate to domestic violence a guy do not blow up a building without that anger spill over at home we should talk to his wife my father would have be proud of these man when he be mayor it be his dream to try to bring industry to our city and we be fulfil that dream and I be proud of our strength in this difficult time and once we get the man out excuse I be Valerie Blunt here we will rely on each other to get through this thank you just as we always have I know you be concern and I will take question one at a time please we meet in high school I be a cheerleader and Jered be a third string run back ridiculous right but we fall in love be you still in love of course I mean you know it be it be not perfect it be it be a marriage I can not believe this happen after everything else this year you and your husband have be through a lot uh no no no I just mean um with how hard it be to to find work around here for anyone maybe he be just crazy what your husband maybe he be just bonker Wha what be you talk I do not know he be argue with the company he be constantly get into fight right what my partner be dance around here be that we think your husband just lose it and blow up the building Jered would never do that what be you do this be not appropriate there be something she be not tell we we be waste time I be sorry I be sick of watch you coddle these woman well I be sick of you derail this investigation you know you can be a bitch sometimes who the hell be you people stay away from I you almost do not sell it I be go to have to hit you hard next time you know you take a little bit too much pleasure in that one Valerie Blunt be disgust when you slap I but she be not afraid she show no heighten sensitivity to violence between a man and a woman I think it be unlikely she be abuse so you do not think her husband could have blow up the building with no violence at home it be hard to believe it be Loker give I a second yeah take it yeah yeah what be that a job yeah you go to tell I what it be I do not need your permission to take on a case that depend on the case do not it really it will be fine I promise that usually mean I be getting screw usually be not that the head of Green City Construction Warren with Mrs Blunt Less than a foot and a half between they a flash glance from she before a quick turn away they 've be intimate before you know Valerie Blunt be hide something when you ask if she and her husband have problem eyelid flutter there be something she do not want to say maybe her husband be not the perpetrator maybe he be the target so Warren sleep with Blunt 's wife and then bury he alive if you would think I would have anything to do with this you be completely out of your mind why would I sabotage my own job my own company for for woman and I get ten guy on this crew at least who can tell you exactly where I 've be on this site every minute of the last three day I have not be down to the substructure for week but you and Mrs Blunt have an affair right it be not an affair they be separate at the time and he would hardly speak to she for six month before they break up why do your relationship end I just be not into it anymore you know I tell she I just be not really feel it you know that be a lot of anger you be show for a woman you do not care about Men usually reserve that kind of anger for woman that they love I do not know why it end okay I think we be on cloud nine we both feel like we be kid again we be out to dinner one night she get a phone call from Blunt she speak to he for about five minute and she bolt out of the restaurant I do not know she go run back to he just like that so you believe he well he be pretty confident about his alibi and he use simile and metaphor when he be talk about Valerie Blunt we be on cloud nine we feel like kid again People do not use that kind of language when they be lie what do you think Blunt tell she that bring she run back there be something go on between they and we still do not know why he show fear when he find out he be go to be rescue I need to know what else Loker find on the footage it be hot down here but there be still air can we zoom in on his left cheek and forehead Sylvia oh there be that thing again what be that Contempt could be contempt its unilateral hey I need to borrow Michael we be go to go meet our billionaire 's girlfriend Nadia Dawson wow yeah easy tiger she be only into guy make ten figure maybe she really love he yeah right what make you so sure the female hanging fly what the female hanging fly she will only mate with a male when he

out more look I do not care if she be into he for his money as long as she be up front about it from the beginning yeah well it be not always so easy to be open about money I always tell woman exactly how much I have in the bank on the first date and you wonder why you never get a second good luck Dr Lightman 's on the line hey so it be a contraction of Blunt 's orbicularis corrugator and frontali muscle I be think contempt maybe he do try to bring down the building after all no that be not contempt well what be it Mr Blunt be a very sick man I would not feel too well either if I be bury under a building he be sick long befor he be bury almost get the feed back up how be your husband how have you know do not do that can you still hear we yeah we hear you get it how be Mr Kisker he be not

Garcia be not the only person that Frank Ambrose owe money to the guy be under a mountain of debt credit card student loan you name it take a look at this Homeowner 's insurance housing price have drop but his home be insure at the value it have before the market collapse his house be worth more to he in ashe than it be stand you think I would burn down my own house I lose everything in that

draw for I what you see the night of the fire I be not do that be all right I do not need to talk to AJ uh what be your relationship with the man that your son 's accuse excuse I be you have an affair with Jack Garcia how dare you accuse I of have an affair in front of my son yeah you be avoid the question be you have an affair with Jack Garcia I be get my son and I be go that be fine but we will be back with a subpoena I suppose we could always talk to your husband and find out what he know about it nine month ago I be out shop and Jack walk up to I in the store he have so much confidence Frank have lose his job we be really struggle we have stop have sex altogether by then so you have an affair every minute with Jack be a chance to be with somebody who do not know I or my problem I think about leave my husband but the child and I be all that he have leave and so I break it off with Jack how do he take it he understand look this have nothing to do with the fire it be easy to believe that be not it I do not know what AJ see but I know Jack Garcia and he would never do something like this to we because of our daughter and sex be never the problem well you want to know why I never cheat on you what about you you would 've know besides I want to kill you I never want to hurt you I think that be what we should focus on here Affairs make for angry spouse right what could possibly make I want to burn down the Ambroses ' house your husband be have an affair with Cheryl Ambrose oh she know already he tell I two week ago if you have already tell your wife then why do not you tell we I want to but she I tell he not to it be not something I want to see in the paper look the idea that my wife would do this be absurd be it she be still angry not at Cheryl Ambrose I know when Jack start in front of the camera it would be different the Jack Garcia you see on tv be not the man I marry but marriage be about figure out how to make it through when thing change she be lie to herself so that be it that be it then People just change and then they move on be you say that I be the one that change you leave I you leave yeah I leave because of you oh it be my fault now no I be say you should take a hard look at what happen before you start blame I hey I see what happen I see what be happen you know I could see the doubt I could see the doubt when you be stand on the bloody altar everyone have doubt Cal everyone at the altar with their friend in the maternity ward stare at the very good thing that be ever happen to they but that do not mean it be the only thing that they feel but you you just you see every doubt every fear by the end that be all you could see you could not let go of anything I be try to be honest yes I know I know but I can tell you sweetheart there really be such a thing as too much honesty in a marriage so what do you want you would rather be with someone who do not really know you then how about someone who do not need to know everything about I who I can surprise on his birthday who do not need to point out every time I be even remotely attract to another man someone with his head up his ass someone who do not study my eyebrow when I be stand in a thong why be you here then why do you hire I eh it be a tough case do my thing right now live it up baby that be how we do it you know that Caden yeah and Little Sid and his crew at an album release party last year the victim Dante Edwards be behind he on the right they come up to I like Little Sid please take I away from this paper wrapper I be about to put a gun in your face right now what be up man check out the fake anger if his anger be real his upper eyelid would be raise and his lip would be narrow the rivalry 's fake that feud be big business sell a lot of album last year so then why would caden or anyone else in his crew want to kill Dante I be think that the murderer 's not in Caden 's crew okay let us take a look at our victim all right which group do Dante look like the man on the left or the man on the right um the man on the left oh you have a sixth sense by that I mean you see gay people you think Dante 's gay yeah and so do you all the man on the left be gay a new study in the Journal of Experimental Psychology show that most people can identify gay man by face alone it have to do with the pattern of muscle tension in the face and check out Little Sid 's new album it be my guitar on target like Dirty Harry I be go to make your day I be go to take your ass out 'cause your ass be gay oh Little Sid be one big homophobe if he find out one of his entourage be gay no tell what he would 've do we be look at the wrong rapper all right take a look at these More drawing yeah so what do they mean uh well here the arsonist have a tail and there he be uh he be breathing fire so they be become more more elaborate exactly if it be a true memory he would stick to what he remember but AJ 's embellish his story wait so he do see Jack Garcia or he do not which one be it well AJ believe his story be true the same way he believe in Santa Claus somebody he trust tell he it be true it be an implanted memory Jack Garcia do not start that fire we need to go talk to AJ 's parent again one of they may be use their son to frame that man maybe you do not leave Jack Garcia maybe he leave you what you hate he for take away what little joy you have do not you you hate he you hate your life so you set fire to your house and you tell your son to say it be Jack you think that I would burn down my own house that fire kill my mother People have

she be miserable in your marriage you have nothing to lose I have no idea that she be have an affair I almost leave my family for Jack why would I want he in jail I have nothing to do with this I would never put my family at risk like that it be not Cheryl no emotion she be show be genuine she be still fond of Garcia that be a shame but it will help I make the case against Frank what he have the motive the mean and plenty of opportunity to implant the memory in his son no he be truly surprised he well hang on Cheryl be have an affair with Jack see he have no idea if he be surprised it be

you be his brother right Antwon how you do Antwon something you want to tell we no well the idea that Andre just point a gun at somebody it be ridiculous I mean that boy never hold a gun in his life I think Antwon would disagree with you there would not you eh what be you talk about you get something you be try not to tell we if you know something say it he have a gun he be getting jump by the conlin terrace crew he get scared so he get a gun to protect himself just because Andre have a gun do not mean he point it at Kuransky and Duke yeah well we can not dismiss the possibility we need to talk to Andre well be there any chance of that happen soon no he be unconscious uh how be it go with the detective I 've be look over month of suspect interview Kuransky be lie everywhere place he be be case he be work also his anxiety when he talk about the shooting that be not from PTSD okay there be definitely something go on with this guy I just do not know what it be all right well keep dig I will be back as soon as possible all right Dr Lightman special agent Owen finnegan with the FBI we need to talk please get in the car why I will explain shortly please get in the car be I under arrest no but I be authorize to compel you should you not choose to accompany we voluntarily please get in the car sir Dr Lightman you be give access to top secret material when you be consult with CIA so I be go to trust you with some information that you should not have sit down you know special agent Kuransky ah you see I know there be something wrong with you Kuransky be one of several special agent undercover in the metro police department why we believe a small group of terrorist have infiltrate law enforcement in dc there be a network of sleeper individual link to al qaeda inside the police force who be help to plan a strike Adam Duke be a member of this network his real name be adamat duka he be albanian by birth and as you may know al qaeda be believe to funnel money through group in Macedonia and Albania he say he change his name to break with his family but that be not true he be still in contact with relative back home we estimate three to five sleeper like Duke be inside the police force that be why he have not be arrest yet we want Duke to identify the other I 've be partner with Duke for 16 month I be inside his head I will get those name what be your source we can not tell you that what be the target we can not tell you that but we do believe it will happen soon very soon if we do not intervene that be why you get to back off the Ricks case everyone in the department know you be look at I and Duke if the other sleeper think you be on to who Duke really be they will kill he then we have nothing if Andre Ricks recover if he could go to jail for a crime he may not have commit and you be tell I to back off because of a terror threat that you will not even describe it be a bit of a joke really no it be not this be real these people want to inflict major casualty on this city and if that happen because you get in the way that be go to be on your head right I 've get a question for you do Andre Ricks have a gun in his hand when Adam Duke shoot he I tell you that already Ye that shoot be good you see there be the problem you be still lie I will see myself out you know the fact that Kuransky be undercover could explain why he appear to be lie about the shooting how well sometimes undercover cop can develop symptom of dissociation I mean pretend to be somebody else can make they anxious and paranoid and it could look like they be lie even if they be tell the truth yeah maybe he be just a bad liar I think we should keep dig I do not think we should be push it on this one what be you FBI now no if they be try to stop a terrorist cell then yeah I want to be careful about get in the way national security be just their favorite bogeyman this whole sleeper cell thing smell fake to I not every threat be a lie you know a plane fly into the pentagon my husband be there I remember that day cal and I would do almost anything to prevent that from happen again well I will tell that to Andre Ricks I be sure he will feel the same way that be not fair not fair to he you can not take the government at their word unless they be right and if an attack be really be plan then everybody be at risk it be Torres a gas station in anacostia got rob last year this image be release by metro police from the security camera recognize the face Andre rob a store yeah I guess he have a gun and know how to use it get that clean up yeah hey a paralegal 's look for you I think the lawyer want to talk to you now yeah I guess so I will just be a minute oh I be wexler by the way Martin wexler do you need to swear I in before we start no no this uh this be not a formal deposition okay uh will there be one later not necessarily depend on what you say do you have a problem with that no no be you sure about that yeah listen ria I be just here for the fact you give I the truth we be good if you do not we be not it be really that simple do you understand there be no problem you clean this up yeah already do it all right then blow it up and again that be the kid the cop shoot Yep yes it be it be an interesting case let I know if there be anything else I can do you can talk less what do you see nothing exactly no contempt no fear not even pleasure that be a face at rest do not look like the face of someone rob a store be it Cops photoshoppe Andre 's face on someone else 's body they be frame he Nah it be not the cop this time that be do with some very good equipment that look like the FBI to I cal good god could your posture get any bad you be a walk question mark How be tRicks at the CIA less amusing since you stop come by I miss your special gift for piss people off so what be so important we have to meet right away the FBI say there be terrorist inside the dc police department be that true why would you want to ask about that 'cause I think they be try to frame a kid to shut down an investigation be this the kid that got shoot by the two cop yeah who be try to frame he special agent by the name of finnegan falsify some evidence I know finnegan he be the straight arrow in the quiver if somebody 's doctoring evidence it be not he what do you know about these sleeper cal you need to steer clear of this one you know well than to tell I that why you so scare Fletcher I read the intel Threat be real this be not hussein and his disappear weapon of mass destruction this be a network finance by people who want to hit we hard half of Langley 's stocking up on duct tape and plastic sheeting what be the target Theory be they be go after government building State department supreme court who know maybe the CIA so the FBI be tell the truth Sleepers inside the police department I do not know but what I do know be you should stay out of it Whatever be go to happen to this kid be nothing compare to what could happen to this city People could get hurt cal a lot of people just to be clear you do not like the fact that your boss be make a deal with Joseph Hollin well I think it be the wrong thing to do

come to work that be the first you hear of it that be right yeah okay do you blow up the deal no do you go to the sec against Dr Foster 's wish no I do not you be a logical person you already admit you do not want it to happen yeah and the reason that you know that be because I just tell you pretty stupid of I to do that if I blow it up be not it okay good that be all I need that be it yes thank you very much for your time all right thank you the income projection you ask for oh yeah and you get a call from Corey strong in the mayor 's office say he could not reach you on your cell that

pout when I ask if he have a gun on the roof he seem genuinely hurt by the idea now you would not see that if he be lie right he could 've deny own the gun altogether he do not Nah he be tell the truth I do not think he be armed when Duke shoot he we need to call the mayor this kid could do 10 20 year yeah but if we do say something what happen to the FBI investigation that be not our concern you want I to lie to the mayor yeah but we ha veto consider it cal Van pull up in front of a building and there be an explosion I mean your contact say the threat be real look there be always go to be another bad guy there be always go to be another kid they be go to want to sacrifice Ricks be unarmed he be the victim here call the mayor hey uh loker you know where ria be she might be downstair get

out the door first I be sorry no that be not right I go out first Eric follow I turn on the tv hey I do not see any sign of deception in Duke if he be a spy I mean how be he hide it turn on the tv what we be say be this be a cover up pure and simple why will not the authority let Kuransky and Duke face their accuser no that be not right no I speak to the mayor why be not Duke in custody the FBI 's hold he they will not turn he over to the dc police national security uh as soon as the kid step out and how far away from Ricks be maybe ten foot what they be not go to get anything out of Duke why you say Kuransky be suffer from dissociation because of be undercover right yeah yeah be undercover be hard to take right be it a problem for Duke No not at all well if he be a terrorist he be be undercover long than Kuransky so his symptom should be bad maybe they get it wrong you know maybe he be not a terrorist I mean that would explain why he do not show any sign of deception he would not have be lie I 've look at over a dozen interrogation and there be no sign of deception in Duke here it be this be the onei've be look for it be Duke question a neo nazi I say this country be a whore bitch de christianize mongrelize obamanize the street be sewer fill with human trash the city reek with moral decay look at Duke see that contempt smile he be offend yeah if he be a terrorist obsess with attack America he would not hate this guy he would agree with he maybe he be not a sleeper the FBI 's have be investigate Duke for over a year how could they get it so wrong have not you do enough you already destroy an undercover operation we spend year put in place it put the wrong man in custody why because Duke do not have a personality disorder because he look irritated when some skinhead yelled at he give I a break you 've be interrogate Duke what have you get you 've be on he for hour you get nothing right you be start to worry start to think you might have screw up can see it in your face you can not afford to make a mistake here Damn it how do we get it wrong about Duke well you may have have some help a photoshopped picture of Andre Ricks be give to the police I do not know anything about that I believe you then you get a big problem here than Duke one of your people have go rogue sorry about the wait what be I do here Finnegan just say show up what be this yeah I want to talk about what sit down about spy see there be two kind of spy right there be the spy that gather good information and then there be the spy that spread bad information yeah I think you be one of the latter what be you say well you say that Adam Duke be a terrorist in fact the whole case against he be base on what you 've say he be a terrorist no he be not which mean that you be either incredibly stupid or you be give bad information to the FBI 's you accuse I of work for the other side you say I be al qaeda I get a picture of Osama in my wallet I do not say it what the hell be you say then see that be good you be pretty good I mean I be not see any fear I be only see anger I mean that photograph though that you send to the police of Andre that be crude that show desperation if

explosion produce casualty then the ambulance would arrive drive by sleeper and stuff with more explosive we would have wave those ambulance right in without think twice because Kuransky have we convince that the terrorist be police he tell the FBI that I be a terrorist what do this have to do with the shooting well Kuransky 's story depend on you be on the police force and when you shoot Andre Ricks he know you could get arrest so he have to make the shooting look justify that shoot be good no it be not when Kuransky get to the street he see Andre be not arm so he put a gun on he he

the Bomber 's soccer team he be get tie to group on our wath list can I talk to he no Deputy Director Messler do not want anyone else in with the suspect she be get deputy in her title for a reason can you go around her yeah that sound good but that be just not how this work how do it work Solitary confinement stress position at Guantanamo Come on now or do you guy set up a new place now with

because Dan 's parent be not home and the last time Dan 's parent be not home you be lecture I about sex we get big issue here I wish you do not have to go in it be my job I 've get to go I just speak to the director he must really like your work no one else be get in but we I coach Jamal at soccer practice he raise money for our charity drive but I never recruit he as a killer your brother be a member of Al Shabab one of the most radical group in the Horn of Africa be not he last month an FBI informant spot Mr Ali with some Afghani national that they 've be track and give his access to the bomber he be our prime suspect your setup 's all wrong here what be all wrong what be you do what the hell be you do what the hell be you do stop it it be all wrong what be that Deputy Messler this be Dr Cal Lightman he be offer to help with the suspect the director have clear we to be here listen I do not care who you speak with get he the hell out of here you 've have four hour with he what do you have you get nothing you get Less than nothing right listen we be go to crack this son of a bitch that be the kind of thinking that lead to Abu Ghraib Good p r for Al Qaeda by the way well do on that one can someone escort he out of here what do you expect I to do this be what the director want you be not go to crack Mr Ali because he be only show one emotion Fear he be scared because he be be catch or maybe he be scared because you throw he in a dungeon and you threaten to render he the Bureau do not render suspect your setup increase fear which put up barrier to get to the truth if you want real reliable information you 've get to alter the condition alter they how I want you in there and I want he out here I speak with Jamal several time in the last month he be very quiet but never angry the kid blow up a bus he be angry about something Agent Young do you have any idea what these accusation will do to our community that be why we want to conduct these interview right away do Jamal ever express any hatred for America we come here to worship not to discuss politic I ask the man to come here so you could talk to they but you must understand they be on guard now we just have a few quick question I be so sorry sorry I want to help you find anyone who be part of this we appreciate your time there be nothing more important Jamal Bata be a member here at Auliyah for almost two year in that time do anyone ever hear he talk about violence be there a heater on in here or something be I the only one who be hot so you accidentally remove your head scarf and what you be gauge the reaction of the man Terrorist s tend to see the world in black and white we think we might get a reaction this be the video capture of the first group of man we talk to when I take off my head scarf there be a lot of reaction shock interest but only one display this that be some intense anger we talk to 11 group about 10 to 12 man each these be the one who show extreme anger any fundamentalist would show that it do not mean they be terrorist it do not but it be a place to start I apologize for the condition before but the road to tyranny be always pave with claim of necessity right I grow up in Somalia I know about tyranny what do you know about the bomb do Jamal ever tell you anything about what he be plan to do I never hear he speak of it these man be possible suspect from the mosque you know this guy what about he no I do not that be the first lie you 've tell we when you speak about Jamal before you be sad if you have be behind these bombing you would have be proud of he I have nothing to do with the bombing I believe you I do I believe you but you 've get to tell we what you be hide because if you do not more child like Jamal will be recruit by the man who do plan this somali child their parent pay we to bring they here we help they get into this country so why be you afraid to tell we that the child be illegal so you be smuggler you and this guy we simply try to give they well life I have nothing to do with this bombing you think he be tell the truth this man be not a terrorist you should move on it be a waste of time oh God another suicide bomber at Maulin Virginia at least ten dead and dozen more have be injure and Al Qaeda 's put up another statement say this be just the beginning a few of the survivor identify the bomber we think he be one of the young man we see at the mosque Rasheed Kahn I just talk to this guy this morning I do not read anything off of he I miss he report live from Virginia Metropolitan where victim be be bring a second deadly suicide bombing this time at the Langley Oaks Mall have D c and citizen of every city in a panic they just confirm it the two bomber be member of the same mosque Hang on a second there be another one my friend go to that mall how many more be there go to be I do not know darling can we please go home soon I do not want you watch any more of this stuff all right it be get to be rough on the kid yeah do you have any video yet no not from the mall and they be still piece together tape from the bus we need photograph of the two bomber interact w00th people that they know People at the mosque or on the soccer field they want I on the scene so all right take Loker with you we need all the video we can find all right you get it hey do not beat yourself up over this all right I talk to the second bomber 3 hour before he go into that mall he kill 13 people I look right at he I do not see anything I completely miss he you would have see it you could have stop this all right 1986 I be in Belfast for the British I let go of a man that night he walk into a pub and he shoot six people three of they dead how have he get by you sometimes they just do I need you focus love yeah this job have open some crazy door this be not one I ever want to walk through the shrapnel pattern 's consistent with most suicide bomb look like they use nail the only good thing be it be a small device Small there ' shrapnel mark 100 foot down the wall if it be big there would be no wall look at this see how the blood be sprayeddown and outward this be where he detonate that be great I will be outside vomiting wait a minute wait a minute no that that do not make sense the food court be only 50 foot away the bomb would have be a lot more effective there know what there be no camera cover this area that be probably why he do it here what do you see that camera catch it that be not point this way no not directly but it be point at what use to be a mirror the angle 's tight but those camera they have wide angle lense a v Club in high school I understand Mr Director I will make sure that Dr Lightman have everything that he need what be we look for Disgust the language of hate any sign on the bomber 's face of someone that they be work with there be nothing here nothing on the bomber 's face nothing on the face of their friend we need more recent photograph something must have change I have the Secret Service on the line for you yeah you must be look for Torres what be this about I be glad that you call too do not do not look I be glad that you call but I just can not do this okay you all right yeah I get a call from Secret Service be they worried about the White House no Dupree 's unaccounted for what torre ' boyfriend FBI have a chatter that mall be be target Secret Service be send in to coordinate security after the first bomb and he be there he be there or he be on his way there it be unclear either way he have not call in since the blast all right I will tell she hey I do not think we should Cal she interview the mall bomber and she miss he she be not responsible she think she be she think she kill those people you want she to think that her boyfriend be one of they she would want to know I 've get call in to the director of the FBI the head of the ATF there be people canvass in the hospital there be nothing that she can do right now I do not know about this we need she focus hey you ready to go you okay yeah let us go you need to let we go home we 've lose our son your son kill a lot of people at that mall he work with you here look like you have some of what he need to build that bomb my son be not a radical rasheed would never hurt innocent people the family be usually the last to know do rashee have any extremist view he love this country you be try to make he into a mujahid that be not he your nephew do not seem to agree what Shame you be ashamed of course I feel ashamed someone so close to I hide a secret like this how can you not know Mrs Kahn what be Rasheed 's day like he would wake up early for prayer have breakfast go to band practice after class he love to edit the school newspaper he volunteer at the mosque he do his homework this be not your fault so that typical day stuff what be that some kind of psych test radical group prey on outcast disaffect kid Rasheed should have be a loner but he be in the band he work on the newspaper he volunteer at the mosque where he could have be expose to other radical he do not fit the profile DOJ want we all over Rasheed Kahn 's school that mean I want to talk to every student and teacher the janitor I want to find out who be absent that day I want to see if there be any substitute teacher can you give I a second please hey how be Emily she be okay I guess the second bomb shake she up a bit yeah she be not the only one what be your law enforcement contact like over at Fairfax County I would say pretty good at the moment I need your help there be a guy I know in the Secret Service and he be on his way to the mall and he be go miss what be his name Karl Dupree with a k yeah okay I be on it good and you be leave soon be not you no coffee stop no supermarket just stay out of the Capitol all right you always do have a funny way of say I love you yeah how be you do kiddo yeah fine hey they be able to put together the tape from the bus and we have video from the mall you be go to want to take a look these be the two suicide bomber moment before detonation their body language be paradoxical could you try use small word that mean more terrorist be usually so afraid of be spot that the keep their head down and avoid make eye contact right but check out the video from the bus Jamal 's get his head up he be make eye contact with the other passenger and look at the mall bomber he be flirt with that woman he be get a classic head tilt he be square his hip to face she he be lean in maybe he pull she in to kill her no there be nothing on his face he be too relaxed for a suicide mission so you be say he do not know Rasheed do not fit the profile he have no history of violence that would explain why torre do not see any anxiety when she talk to he so no anxiety no determination these be the face of innocent not suicide bomber Forensic analysis find that remote detonator be use in both bombing those young man be victim too they have no idea what they be do but the terrorist want the world to believe that they do the idea of homegrown suicide bomber choose to blow themselves up be a lot scary than some foreign radical planting bomb on people I need you to find out who have access to both kid all right rasheed be target he have no idea that he be carry the bomb that be why you could not read he when you be by talk to he yeah but somebody plant a bomb on he and I might have miss they no you do not miss anything we need to look hard at the mosque go look at the tape any word on Dupree no nothing yet we will tell her swhen we know something new but she know she be not responsible for the second bombing now we 've have two bomb in a day More be likely she be one of the few people who can actually help find these guy the most productive thing she can do for Dupree she be do it what about that Guy keep rub his arm no we clock he when we be there Arthritis confirm it with his medical record I be move to Israel if I be go to live somewhere where I can get blow up in a bus or in a mall at any time I want beach and I want woman who speak their mind you do not have much of a filter do you he call it radical honesty it grow on you wait go back what go back to the point when the Imam walk in front of the camera look at his eyebrow they be raise and pull together how in the hell do you see that do he seem that anxious when you talk to he no nothing like that maybe he be just nervous about we talk to his man maybe it be something else I be not a murderer see after 9 11 I we all struggle I be from Saudi Arabia I study at the same mosque as one of the hijacker I never believe in their brand of Islam and I realize that to be an American I have to honor my country and my religion so I call the FBI office and offer to help you be an informant if anyone I have concern about come into the mosque I would make a call Deputy Messler never say anything about that I only work with one man Agent Richard Squire do you know he no not well he leave the Bureau right after the administration turn over you do not like he very much he take advantage one day he ask I about an argument I have with a congregant at a private ablution ceremony there be no way he could have know about the argument so he bug the place Audio surveillance over the ablution fountain here in the prayer hall in the bathroom if the FBI be willing to do that before you tell I what will they do now so so the FBI have no record of any bugging and audio surveillance be a major operation the Imam be tell the truth maybe Squire do it on his own well there be a lot of cowboy after 9 11 so it be certainly possible but if he do tap this mosque I want those tape find your man Dupree just get off the phone with Fairfax County p D they confirm he be at the mall yeah thank what Dupree be in the mall he be in the elevator when the bomb go off he be alive he be unconscious oh my God take my car Virginia Metropolitan excuse I ma'am we have to get he to surgery how be he do he be get blood in his brain a hematoma he be in an elevator for four hour nobody know where he be what be that what that look do you know you know he be miss there be nothing you could have do nothing I could have do Ria oh wait I see I see okay it be not it be not you be it Lightman decide not to tell I everything possible be be do to find Dupree and Cal rely on you Ria I do not believe this I really do not Lightman play God and you make excuse for he you leave I the hell alone I serve the Bureau for 22 year do not want to work for some kind of castrate version of the DOJ so I leave oh be that why or do someone find out about your illegal operation at the mosque there be no illegal operation I do not think that be true while you people be whine about civil liberty extremist be plot against this country maybe you will quiet down now that we have bomb blow up in our backyard you know you do not seem particularly upset about these bombing quite the opposite in fact islamic extremism be flourish under our nose if I be ambivalent maybe it be because I see a silver line 40 people be dead where be the silver lining if we allow this administration to dismantle our security operation it be go to be 40 000 here be the thing Dick you be a disgruntled ex agent wait for someone to call you back so you can be a fourth quarter hero and I bet you still have those surveillance tape and I be pretty sure you would not have leave they lay around here for your wife or your maid to trip over no because guy like you you think that the work you do be so damn important I be even willing to bet you get yourself one of those Dick Cheney man size safe let us take a look next week 's fine okay no I still do not have a permanent address everything be just go to go into storage all right thank you how you do it be so crazy I mean I hear 40 people die already and a bunch of they be my age yeah it be but everything be go to be fine adult always say that but I mean it be not fine you know what you be right but not every day be go to be like this you know my mom 's be spend all this time with Dad I mean they think I do not know it be like they do not even remember how bad it be they will have to figure it out for themselves maybe it will be different you do not believe that he be so much happy when he be with you your mom 's here you should pack up your stuff I just come to pick up Emily what be in the box it be the surveillance tape from the mosque the two bomber belong to illegally obtain surveillance tape an FBI agent go rogue and bug the place where do we stand well they be worthless in court if that be what you be ask I be not too worried about prosecute right now yeah but if you use the tape you legitimize the bugging right Law enforcement be always give some latitude if there be an imminent threat what about afterwards when if this get out it could lead to more terrorism and how would it come out these thing always do Intelligence say there could be 5 or 6 more bombing this week what if there be something in those tape that could help prevent that okay give they to Foster and Loker let they start in that be what I want to hear we be through the first 1 200 hour already how be that possible well normal vocal pitch be less than 500 hertz anything high imply extreme emotion anger anxiety or fear that be what the computer 's scanning for what do we get off the tape from the mosque the first hit be a marital dispute the second be a 7 year old and the third be a guy who really need to find a bathroom look like we 've another winner it be unacceptable completely unacceptable People who do thing like this must be punish Stress be up on all the negative word and you hear that vocal tremor that could be repulsion or disgust how the hell be we suppose to match a voice with a name Foster never forget a voice some o ' we be well at listen than other thank you my son be not a radical it be the same voice Omor Kahn Father of the second bomber it be unacceptable completely unacceptable People who do thing like this must be punish where be this record in our mosque someone record private conversation in the mosque absolutely you do not deny that be your voice I will take that as a no do you have the shrapnel plot from FBI forensic yet check it out look how perfect the blast radius be that bomb be small compact it would 've to be if somebody slip it into those kid ' backpack what be you accuse I o ' someone plant bomb on Jamal Bata and your son they be murder my boy be murder uh you know I be think maybe it be not slip in I be think Maybe'twas conceal maybe someone give they the bomb disguise as something else do you think that I could sacrifice my own son where be the sacrifice I think virgin await he Rasheed be kill by extremist my family and I we be the victim one o'those kid play soccer you pack a soccer ball with enough ball bearing you get the right idea but the concussion diameter be only 200 foot the bomb be not that big they teach you that at Quantico a week in Tel Aviv with Shin Bet I be an american citizen you can not treat I like this do we 've info on what the shrapnel be this say small piece of aluminum glass shard copper and nickel Copper and nickel huh just like on the bus pretty much Forensics figure part of that be from the coin in the fare box Coins Copper and nickel what if the coin be part of the bomb the coin be the shrapnel I think I know how the bomb be disguise Omar Kahn have not give you one straight answer yeah his son 's dead he be a little angry it look like a killer 's rage to I I be turn he over to the CIA they will do what it take to get he to talk do you know what they call a place that break the law everytime there be an emergency dictatorship where have you go what what do you mean what this be what you use to plant the bomb in I talk to the Imam every family that belong to that mosque have access to one of these you put the explosive in the bottom of the canister and the coin act as the shrapnel that think you have that think right there horrify you you be not behind this be you but you know who be be it someone close to you someone you see with these canister it could not be who could not it be what if you be wrong what will they do to he what would happen you accuse my son of be a murderer you

will get it I will get it you know you be never go to get that through custom why not because I be go to call they I be go to tell they you get a suspicious package that be the kind of pain in the ass I can be if I do not get the truth it be just a hunch there be a fertility center here that match egg donor with couple we be from Canada and it be illegal to purchase egg there the donor stay anonymous but they can choose who they want to donate to these be our frozen embryo so you think that Marla Seeger be your egg donor for a moment but then we realize that it could not be her she be nothing like the person the broker describe to we you find my mom not yet that be lovely welcome to the age when they need you but think they be smart than you she always be all right I 've get one for you Marla Seeger be a waitress in a diner right Ramona Posner be a teacher 's aide how do two woman like that afford fabulous trip to Zulia how Marla Seeger come here as an egg donor she be give herself hormone injection right and the needle that the cop find hence the mood swing can I help you Cal Lightman yeah he be here just the man I want to see you need to call in some of those embassy resource can not someone from the police department call my boss I 've be reassign and threaten our egg donor have high iq be from stable background they do not have drug alcohol or mental health problem and many of they be star athlete how specific can we be in how the donor look I have a couple here they be seek someone at least 5'9 blond blue eye athletic and an Ivy League school we find a match yesterday it be only 50 000 in the state it would be double that we be in here how do you harvest the egg then our reproductive endocrinologist Dr Alvarez he be responsible for everything how much do you pay the donor the fee be generous plus they get a free trip to Zulia but no one do it for the money they just want to help the right couple have a child that be wonderful that be wonderful yeah it be great we actually be look for a donor with blue eye and light brown hair and 5'6 I think I can arrange that Thought you be go to say that Dr Alvarez these be the Garrs pleased to meet you may I talk to you please can it wait no no we 've get to shove off anyway we get to go we 've get to think yes I mean it be a big decision I 've get a question for you Dr Alvarez we 've be tell that my wife 's infertility be due to an estrogen imbalance cause by the coriolis effect be that possible that could very well be true do you see Wynn when I describe Marla Flared nostril quick breath he be in this there be no way all those donor fit the criterion he describe wait see they do not have to they find donor like Marla Seeger who be desperate for money they insist the donor remain anonymous Wynn can give the buyer any description he want it be a con yeah absolutely it be a con be not the coriolis effect something about the earth 's rotation exactly Alvarez agree with your theory that be because Alvarez be not a doctor he be a fake I be in charge of blood order here and Yager coordinate trade for the other hospital in DC so why do I have to reinterview these two guy because we 've get nothing else he be exhibit extreme control he could still be hide something no voice pitch be steady Dunst be not lie but why do Yager keep look behind he and why be he anxious what have I miss what happen to the reporter I take care of her that could mean so many thing so the story will not be on the news that be what you want right do Cal brainwash you into think I be kind of medium whore without scruple Come on tell I you get something 'cause the tox screen 's all negative and the CDC be get all kind of call from reporter I can charm one reporter I can not control the entire fourth estate we have the 5 car pile up on the beltway wait something be different I have to change the battery so we take a little break but they be both more relaxed now and Yager 's not look behind he go back to before the break he be look at that they got rid of it why do not they want we to see it what can we do for you we need to take a look around how often do you give blood every 6 week or so I have a rare blood type what be you look for find it that be sensitive equipment what be it for processing patient fluid sample could you be any more vague it be positive for narcotic so you 've be run a drug lab down here where 's Marla Seeger I do not know who that be not true you be the couple from the office today no your partner Wynn sell you out make a deal with the police he say the scam be your idea he never say that Dr Alvarez be responsible for everything a lie I can assure you it be perfectly true what happen to her she be one of our egg donor she be not do well on the hormone treatment she want to get the procedure over with then she change her mind Wynn bring she in anyway this be all his do what happen to Marla I start the egg extraction but there be complication and I puncture something she start to bleed so where be she Wynn have an apartment she be die one more day we would have lose she listen how do you know that I be not part of the coverup when I accuse you you show genuine anger not guilt about that man you send to threaten my daughter that be not I that be my boss you sure this man be part of the cartel if I be you I would keep he away from the evidence locker I will keep an eye on my boss too Rader and Foster bust a drug lab he be say she be brilliant and have all right keep it to yourself Lou from the embassy ask I to stay Lou from the embassy that be nice he ask I to stay few more day I say yeah be that all right and here I be think we be happily marry the two tech be make designer fentanyl in the hospital lab they be use the blood as a means of transport Liquid fentanyl be inject into the blood bag which would then be deliver to all the heroin processing center in the city a lab within a lab pretty ingenious Problem be the new guy Tomkins pick up the wrong bag one day and the fentanyl never trigger any alarm in the patient tox screen because it be a common anesthetic use for surgery sorry I be late they fill you in I guess we will reopen the central blood bank and track down all the unit that leave Euclid Park hospital thank to you you should both know that I tape an interview with McKenzie Dodd

you doing man how you doing Carlos Good so can we talk about the deal of course just follow I so I I have a chance to take a look at the number Mr Greene 's proposal be not a request Nick yes but feel free to take as much time as you need to think about it happy new year so I sign this and I be good right as long as you testify you will have total immunity with new identity for you your wife and kid and Kimi Come on I can not give to your mistress a protection just like I tell my wife I be not leave Kimi Elliot Greene 's not a forgiving man you do not sign we cut you loose you will be dead in a day welcome to your new home drive get out of here get away from the window what get away from the bloody window why what be go on a sniper just kill Mark McLaughlin while he be in protective custody be he someone from one of our case he be a case Reynolds be work before he come here all right Lightman do not say another word ok McLaughlin be Reynolds ' run buddy in an assortment of crime right you be not suppose to know that you work here I know everything do somebody want to fill I in Reynolds be undercover for 2 year try to dismantle Elliot Greene 's organization in New York Greene the Wall Street guy Mobster killer extortionist Mark be the lead witness in the case now he be dead Reynolds be the next in line to testify the prosecutor be on his way over to put you into protective custody you seem to have a problem with that I do they get a spotty track record at good would you bet your life they could keep you safe okay so what do you have in mind follow I you be the prosecutor right Garrett den where 's Reynolds he be in the loo this be Foster why be he in there we have to move now well 'cause your last witness get his head blow off and he work here my office my rule you be way out of line now he be my new lead witness and he be leave with I well that be bulletproof glass that be reinforce door he stay until I put in the code so you be hold he prisoner Hostage I will release he if my demand be meet give I Agent Reynolds now or I will have your company shut down and charge you with obstruction that be not go to get he out of there we be all concerned about his safety so let us just try to work out a deal you have a list of demand secure our building until we know he be safe that be unnecessary US marshal be fully capable of protect Agent Reynolds you do not sound too sure about that the only one I do not trust be the 3 guard McLaughlin only they know where he be go my office be conduct an investigation into those marshal yeah you give they to I and then I will let Reynolds go his life be in danger you ask he who he trust to get to the bottom of this you or we you be the only one who know the safe house location one of you give up your witness it be not possible if there be someone dirty on my team they all flash fear when they hear Elliot Greene 's name what do this guy do he be a Wall Street fixer if a hedge fund be look for inside information Greene 's people do whatever it take to get it for they what do it normally take Blackmail kidnapping torture murder our identity be keep secret even from each other who do Greene get to the US marshal do not hire turncoat just a minute can I borrow you all right this gentleman here be from the US attorney 's office and it be his job to put whichever one of you 3 kill McLaughlin in prison right well you two ok go on out go on I want to talk to you what do I do they be scared they might be work with someone connect to Greene only you show additional fear when you be threaten with jail time so what do Greene do do he pay you off do he threaten your family no something else what do you simply not like McLaughlin Mark be an obnoxious lowlife and a scumbag but I do not want he dead keep an eye on he all right what we question the marshal or wait for Lightman to come back I do not know but I be sure it be some kind of test so be that our guy or not what can you tell I about the case now McLaughlin 's dead his death be a disaster I have to restructure my entire approach to the trial and without Reynolds I do not have a case do his voice sound like his face look to you there be a upturn in his vocal pitch when he mention McLaughlin 's death do you have he kill that be absurd he be my lead witness he be at a meeting with you before he be murder you know the exact place and time he be be move of course I be an assistant US attorney for God 's sake and yet you be happy he be dead it make sense he have a rap sheet a mile long and he only cut a deal with you because you have he by the throat I mean if it be I I would much prefer a highly decorate FBI agent as a witness do you have Mark McLaughlin kill be you people on drug do you have any idea he be about to be murder absolutely not that be the truth thank you now get back with that marshal no he be a puppet I be more interested in the guy who be pull the string you want I to get you in front of Elliot Greene absolutely if you want the truth this will tell you if I have swine flu it be a prerequisite for a body cavity search I be kid just kid Mr Greene how be we feel today fine I guess what just fine it be not every day the lead witness in a case against you gets kill who be you I be a friend of the witness that be about to step in to keep you behind bar I be also a doctor and you be entitle to a lawyer do not need one tell I how have you get to McLaughlin do you pay off one of the marshal do you threaten he someone high up the food chain no it be not that either it be funny be not it a man gets kill today you be face another murder count that be funny tell your friend I be confident that I will be clear at trial you believe that do not you I have nothing to fear you think you can kill my friend who be your friend the man I know as Carlos Benjamin Reynolds right if you think that federal agent be go to be the guy who be go to take I down ask he about his old friend Scotty what be up I just have a very interesting chat with your friend Elliot Greene he say he have no intention of harm you forgive I if I do not believe he do you know why he be not worried about your testimony half of what I know could send he away for life do the name scotty mean anything to you there it be there it be let I see that case file what be you look for ok there what be that can we quit screw around here Greene 's trial be in 4 day yeah well that be not go to matter because I be not testify I get nothing without you just use the surveillance tape that should be enough you be my witness who authenticate the tape and nail the guy and as a federal agent you do not have a choice in the matter I do have a choice you sacrifice 2 year of your life to build this case and now I be do sacrifice if you do not take the stand you will be fire from the FBI and we will press charge against you I be not testify you can not do that watch I I 've see that face before you need to call I back as soon as you get this I 've get a big problem here call I as soon as you get to the office have you lose your mind that be funny 'cause I be about to ask you the same question why be you do this to I Lightman I get it ok you be concerned and I appreciate that but you really need to back off ok I be the man that be keep you safe you know what this be this be another one of your ego trip you can not rest until you find out what I 've be keep from you no it be not about I it be about the pain you be feel now so you just see it all huh but see you have no idea None I 've have to make brutal choice before to arrive at the right outcome listen when I be undercover on the Greene case my father he die I do not go to the hospital or the funeral so do not talk to I about tough choice well then testify go on make the sacrifice count for something just shut up and give I my phone who be you call Sheila Radotti who be she she be my handler on the case do she know why you will not testify I have not speak to she in month I get it so you be investigate I for they to keep you in here Funny you do not mention that before just try to get to the truth Ben and I bet you will serve I up to get it be there anything in the case file from Reynolds ' handler she write most of it the language suggest she be intelligent I mean meticulous and emotionally attach to Reynolds you think he be shag his boss I can not confirm that from the case file but her feeling for he run deep I wonder if he feel the same way you think he be try to protect her he be protect someone that be it I be go in Lightman will be furious that you interfere I be go to go find out what he want then he will be angry that we do not take the initiative soon if I be go to get yell no matter what I might as well get in the game you come describe the event of this morning I wake up at 5 15 a m I take a shower I got dress interested in what I do in the john Skip ahead to after that I wake mark up and I take he to his meeting with the U S attorney you skip some step there what happen between wake he up and take he out of the safe house the usual he get ready and we leave do he brush his tooth do he shower talk we through it I be not with he in the bathroom you screw up when Mark be in the bathroom what do you do who do you tink you be I 've be decorate 3 time in the line of duty but you make a mistake this morning so what be it tell we or your career end today we can see to that I could hear Mark talk in the bathroom and I catch he use the cell phone he be not suppose to have one and I be guess you do not report it I toss it I do not think it would compromise our security tell we where you ditch the phone special agent Radotti I 've leave you a few message I be sorry I have not get back to you I be on my way to a briefing on the hill and I be kind of in a hurry no problem I will walk with you I really need to talk about agent Reynolds I can not discuss any of the detail of the Greene case I be more concerned about why he be refuse to testify I wish I could help you but we have not speak since he be reassign and they do not even tell I where you be his only lifeline to the outside world when he be undercover you must have some insight I just find out that he be refuse to testify and it shock I it be not like he he be a model agent the gold standard Model agent gold standard you be lavish all sort of praise on he but you do not act very concerned let I clue you in about what it be like for people to work together undercover I 've counsel agent after they 've complete undercover assignment then you should understand that there be a very strong bond between Ben and I I do not want to see he ruin or in prison then you should want he to testify to get in with Greene 's organization Ben be authorize to commit minor crime to play the role of a criminal he assault people make threat use narcotic I 've be there even if you be authorize to break the law it change you how do it change Reynolds he be authorize to use drug not abuse they and if he testify it will all come out we have reason to believe someone name scotty be keep he off the stand Scotty Villarosa be that someone Reynolds use drug with among other thing when we sweep up Greene 's crew we never find scotty he just disappear get away we could really use your help back at my office and Reynolds really need a friend can you come down and talk to he anything for Ben I will head over after the briefing I do not think that they be romantically involve she care for he she paint a pretty ugly picture with her word so what do you see the whole drug thing with Reynolds do it bother you do it unsettle you be it flashback to your ex husband if I be upset it be because this just get twice as complicated I be marry to Alec give I insight into how addict can lead double life do not read I you be suppose to be read she sorry love that be Alec this be Reynolds who be refuse to testify in order to protect himself accord to she but protect himself from what I do not know maybe we do not know Reynolds as well as we think we do do not throw your career away like this all right everybody out go on this be my investigation go on thank for your help oh do not do that do not try it I be on to you really you should see how pointless it be for you to keep come at I like that you be wrestle

the guard because you never see he so you go to the real source I will be supervise these interview Waylon say he be shop for family Eye shift downward say otherwise educate guess he be there for someone else like his mistress oh and he be not your only client with a truthfulness allergy Delisha fake anger when Rita ask she about her arm her eyebrow never pull together lip never press or

she be not your mother you do not know what you be talk about I give birth to he in Virginia and then I see that be a lie what be you go to do you just go to keep they come or be you do now have you be drink today no I do not think it be alcohol I think it be drug so what be your drug of choice back in the day be it X Meth Coke there it be cocaine what do you do do you sell he for drug how do you get he I be on the pipe back then I get close with my dealer he have this crash pad in d C and I get there and there be this baby who be baby I do not know I do not know he be crash and he say he be go to smother he so I take the baby you kidnap he you be try to protect he I see this ad these people want a baby so I say I be his mother what be the name of your drug dealer back in the day I only remember he as Romeo it be a long time ago of course Max say he be fine he be a 16 year old boy yeah but that do not mean you have to coddle he do it a hard truth in the long run be far well for you than a soft lie we be talk about a child and what child be we talk about Foster here disapprove my parenting technique which I think be a bit of a cheek do not you so you be not actually talk about let us say an adolescent boy should we be you then maybe you two can explain something to I I will do my level good try to picture this I be in Hilton Head eighth hole 2 under par good game of my life then all of a sudden I get this call from my FBI supervisor wonder if my interest in 16 year old boy be business or purely recreational and which be it well see that be what I be hope that you can help I with because it seem like somebody here in d C use my personal i d number and password to access an FBI database but when I be not actually in d c that set off alarm so can either of you tell I who I should blame for ruin my vacation sorry I just I hear what happen be there anything I can do you could stop look at I like you think I be a freak or screw up I do not think you be screw up I think your family be there be a big difference perfect girl with the perfect life 's some expert on mess up family now my dad 's a human lie detector I have a family history of suicide and my divorced parent sleep together sporadically fight constantly and still insist we get together on holiday how be that for perfect at least you know who your parent be anything I can do to help I promise one freak to another you know I go away for one weekend and you two start act like Bonnie and Klyde you be do Christmas with I no one need to convince I that bring the authority into this case be a bad idea if you have come talk to I first I could help avoid all of this any chance that can happen now because of what these people do a kidnapper get away abduct a baby Mr and Mrs Roland be you here about Max have you see he no what happen he leave a note he run away we have a warrant for your arrest you be be charge with false adoption and child endangerment come on let us go so bottom line they be say we provoke it but they do not have anything concrete just firsthand account well the news footage do not show anything your security guard they mention anything about bully your customer look People resent authority I get it my dad be a cop Mr Bernardo uh one of the thing we do be look at body language and we 've find that sometimes when people be feel vulnerable they tend to cover their gonad can you pull up that photo you show I last month you want I to do it Churchill at Yalta Roosevelt and Stalin be divvye up the world Britain 's be leave out the hat placement say it all now what be it you be not tell we we have some security video of the parking lot and the storefront what do it show thing get a little heated between the guard and some of the customer but that be 10 minute before the stampede that be embarrassing but it be not a direct cause you be try to bury the evidence we do not want the nightmare of someone post it online but since you sign a non disclosure agreement I be happy to share it Cheyenne 's description match a former drug dealer on record who go by the name Romeo like she say but the guy drop off the grid a few year ago all right what do reynold say about Max there be still no sign of he if he be on the run first person I would want to talk to be Emily bad boy fixate in find the truth she probably feel like she be know he her whole life they have not find Max yet where be the cop look for he I do not know you get any idea on that oh sure he be at the secret hideout where all the teenage runaway go he be just some mess up kid who got screw over you should take that really thank they find Max 's biological parent they be bring they in that be great I mean that be great right Max be go though and the state he be in when he run he could be about to do something that could ruin his entire future I need you she know where Max be thank for that oh for lie to Emily so I would not have to Romeo 's real name be Ray Blake narcotic distribution assault spend 8 year in prison any family who know where to find he he have a daughter but she die while Blake be in prison they will be happy to see you no matter what there he be thank God where be my real parent I do not find they find you though thank em now I would have expect this kind of thing from he but you lie to I I know no she do what she have to do to help Max he be in trouble help he you get his parent arrest and then you make I lie to he to get he back here he will be safe here till you send he off to Foster care the FBI know we have he we will figure this out now who be he go to trust do you find Blake all we 've get be his old parole officer that be it Foster come on Mr Donnelly you be the parole officer for a convict name Ray Blake right in my old life Ray Blake he be a drug peddler use to go by the name of Romeo no logical reason why do you have any idea where we could find he now Creep be a gambler OTB in Bethesda be about the only place I could ever count on find he you seem a little angry about your past life what you do not like be a parole officer then you know my old boss send I to the department shrink I do not think I need another one how have you end up in that chair that be a little personal do not you think very personal I would say I get a game to get back to either you do something really bad back then or something really bad be do to you which be it that be none of your business it be this be important fine 16 year ago somebody break into my house kill my wife put a bullet in my back and steal our baby son I break the crowd into sector I follow 6 people at a time from the minute they show up till the riot start you find someone to pin it on watch this guy he move through the crowd this guy grab he pull he back a second later the sector behind he surge forward Mob mentality take over who do you think be in that stampede they be not peace love hippie Working people Loker parent who can afford game system and mp3 player one day a year so desperate to make their kid happy they wake up at 4 am to stand in line you be prove my point Contagion theory say crowd infect the people in they you can dress it up with science all you want it be still an agenda you be try to impress Lightman if I bring home 7 figure he have to respect that I do not know why Lightman screw with you the way he do or why he be get it in for you but I would not get my hope up about thing change let us take Lightman out of it this video do not lie let us go see the guy and see who be right why be you cut the line someone say the door be open Guess I get excite the look on your face be not excitement it be not even aggression that be panic you be afraid before the stampede even start my daughter I tell she to stay close and when I hear she cry it be every parent 's bad nightmare then the crowd start move before I could get to her be she ok she got knock down her arm be break in 3 place I do not know what we be go to do about her hospital bill she be not hurt in that stampede like you 've claim it happen before that do not it you think I hurt she but I do think that you be an opportunist just tell we the truth how do she break her arm it be not in the stampede be it she fall when I hear she cry I panic I went look for her and the crowd think that you be break its first rule do not cut the line or they see you move forward and assume the doors're open either way what they could not contemplate in that state of mind be a father rush to help his daughter ok so what happen those people who die it be my fault he turn up this week be you say that you might have find my son Alive that be his photo but they clear all my parolee Blake fool they apparently when be the last time you see Blake maybe a year or two before that night maybe more I have give he a random drug test that he fail that be what send he back to prison Blake 's daughter die while he be serve that sentence I think he blame you for break up his family he leave you to live with the pain just like he feel you do to he whatever the the only thing that matter now be my son so what if the dna match he will come home that be not up to we well

for Lightman way where be you go do you put he up to this how your technique be foolproof right here be the problem Martin Walker 's a psychopath probably a killer just think you should know La lie to Team present Episode 211 beat the Devil in a healthy kid you would expect to get arousal and revulsion what we get in Martin be revulsion and arousal Revulsion can appear to be arousal marker be similar it say so right in your book those picture be not proof of anything Dr Lightman we see the same indicator in Ted Bundy Bundy he be a good look fella kill about 60 woman give or take Dr Lightman be prone to the dramatic be not we all please Martin expose your science to be flaw therefore he have to be punish Dr Foster do you concur with your colleague I do not see what he see but read facial cue be not my specialty it be mine and I suggest you bring he in for psych evaluation without something more substantial I can not justify that kind of action all right if the university be not look into at least one miss person case I will eat my shoe I think I be on to something here a sophomore girl go miss a month ago the police have no evidence of foul play it be an open case and

what you see as extraterrestrial when the Greeks see lightning in the sky they attribute it to Zeus and when the Aborigines witness Halley 's Comet they think it be a mighty shaman that be the trap that always ensnare we the need to explain this UFO claim seem like it be part of a pattern last year you take the biology class to the county morgue then there be a 3 am comet gaze workshop you hold

become such a Fascist Pentagon 2003 among other place it show we both know this be not about Martin this be about we Us be 23 year ago I think I be over it interesting how you remember the exact number of year Bloody fascinating be not it you can not quantify behavior Cal which be what you be try to introduce to people I provide a tool all right people misuse that tool it be not my fault look at Martin all right he be a loony if I be right you could be put these woman in danger and if you be wrong I will recycle one thing about Cal be he be insufferable sometimes have he always be like this only more so a word he be not someone for the long haul we be not a just keep your distance or you could find yourself a very lonely woman one time he bring in these kitten and say we should dissect they and this girl Lisa completely freak and call the cop but he be just teach we to question authority do Mr Hickson ever say anything about alien he say he see something and ask we what it could have be and fly saucer make it on the list right underneath the magic brownie you do not think that be funny Andre 'cause that thing you do where you just look down and away that be regret Ease up on the Jedi mind trick okay everyone you do not know I maybe you be the person who tell people that Mr Hickson see alien I do not say nothing and I be not on trial what be with the shame do you see the same thing Hickson see I do not see anything look you can either sack up right now or you can spend the rest of your life wonder if what you see be real and if you could have save Mr Hickson 's job it be real you like Mr Hickson so you photoshoppe it look he do not forge it that be exactly what I see be the video real yes or no if this be what you see it must have be pick up on radar and not then there be get to be an explanation like the air force do not be lyin ' we need to draw them out we need get something we can read how be you go to do that film at 11 00 Martin should be home any

be you I think you and Helen have a lot of unresolved issue I think you two be a couple when you be her student and I do not think you like your replacement you know you be start to sound a lot like Helen I mean that in the nice possible way when I be sure you be right about Martin I will back you 100 here maybe this will help convince you it be just lay about he have a sister apparently yeah there be no picture of she in the house though not that I could see anyway what be this that be video of little Martin and presumably an old sister and where do you get it from borrow it be that the background yes and I do not have to break any law to get it here obviously Martin have a sister her name be Marcy she be 2 year old than he what happen to her she drown in pool when she be 7 Police

killer I get woman alone attack they what do you want to make a point and what point would that be if Lightman be right about I you would already be dead so to be clear the Lightman group be put its hard win reputation on the line for a UFO sighting now that we have a second eyewitness and physical evidence we think that it be time that we get some answer from our government be not you worried this could become a national security issue if the Air Force be tell I the truth and they do not pick up an object this size then we 've already get a huge problem Mr Hickson be tell the truth when you know that why not bet the ranch I be go to show you a picture ok be this the man who attack you Valerie that be a yes the police interview Martin you want look at this case file they probably would let he go with an apology yeah you got that right Dummies I think you be off chase ufo yeah the office tell I where you be that be he this guy he this guy he just buy I a cup of coffee he be go to take I to a concert but I be how do you realize that that be he he say he know Lightman say that if he be really the killer I would be dead be that the girl he attack yeah you ok yeah she will be fine now you be here make yourself useful go in there and bond with Valerie over be alive I understand Valerie what happen to you it almost happen to I too look at I Valerie this guy bump into I at a pastry shop by the time we get outside he feel like a friend and that be what he do he appeal to who we be like he see we when nobody else do look I know this be painful but you be alive Valerie the next girl might not be he drown I over and over all that water I die 3 time Bastard waterboarde she I be so sorry and when I would come to his mouth would be on mine and then he would do it again and again I beg he to just let I die but he would not maybe he do can you bring he in now hell yeah Valerie identify you as her attacker I be sorry for her I really be but if the police believe she would not I be under arrest you stalk she do Cal coach the girl get she to name Martin I know how manipulative he can be she be barely responsive well if you see her file she spend half her life on antidepressant here be how it happen Valerie come on to I you should know that we be get a warrant to search your car if we find any evidence that she be in it you will I give she a lift home one night from the library yeah but see the thing be she never make it home you try to drown she 3 time then you drag she into the wood and try to bury she that never happen she be obviously troubled anyone can see that that be why you pick she she be trouble she be vulnerable you prey on the weak right Martin all I be do be show the girl some kindness no she be the perfect victim you like to traumatize she you break she she beg to die and she be just your type that be not true I like strong woman like Helen you mean she be a strong woman tell I how do that work with you two do you play the woman in that whole scenario do you who be the pitcher who be the catcher be you just follow order you do what she say be that it right I would not worry though I be sorry do you think what be go on between you two be real do you well take it from I it be not I 've be there no she be have dozen she get bore she move on like hell I think we be do here be not we Martin if you say so Martin 's go you see enough he never admit to anything what do you expect he to must be frightening fall for a monster okay so you know I figure that be why you have a problem with he the fact that he and I be well and now you know well well you should right come with I where be we go Scene of the crime he torture and kill young girl every girl he torture or kill be on your conscience Mrs Walker I only let you in here because Helen have be a friend to Martin Nonsense you feel guilty because you get a killer for a son how come there be no picture of your daughter anywhere do he kill she do he push she in the pool you can not face the truth can you so you pretend she do not exist she never exist I mean that be the game here right please I put my trust in Martin my faith I do care about he now I need to know that be one hell of a Rogue 's gallery World 's great con man yeah more like psychos yeah to live with themselves to deny their humanity it be quite a trick you know if you can pull off something like that it be not really hard to fool the rest of we your friend Loker tell I yeah I should have see it ah kiddo you probably get he right I too for that matter what do you mean well I be a crackpot it be not all I be but it be the truth from time to time and in a small enough moment even a cold blooded killer can be sincere seem charming even now how he get that way I do not think that a mystery anybody can solve it must be hard be somewhere 30 year and try to make sense of all this what be hard be they confuse grow old with grow stale Mr Hickson I be Colonel Gorman you be look for answer I 've get some for you be there some place we can talk privately without big brother ever hear the term shatter bone it be Air Force code for a b 1 bomber that be hijack or miss with a nuke on board this be what your client witness 2 week ago that be Captain Eric Eeubauer decorate veteran crack and break radio contact we shoot he down 500 mile off the Carolina coast this be not a standard issue aircraft but this do seem like a standard issue lie it might not have look like it on the ground but there be a flash drive with cockpit video in the file so what do you want we to do to go along with some sort of coverup I would not call it that what happen be a tragedy for the pilot 's family and an embarrassment for our base be you nervous Colonel this be a sensitive case I tell my CO that give your relationship with the FBI we could trust you I wish the feeling be reciprocal the good lie be cover with half truth I have no doubt that you have a pilot who crack who be shoot down everything in that file happen as describe you have no idea what be in the sky that night do you that be the good answer you be go to get out of we Mr Loker if your client 's smart he will accept it Smart or spineless the Air Force be never go to admit to a violation of US air space not by a russian MIG or by a UFO you and I know that but we also know that what Mr Hickson see be not a b 1 so what there be a way for the Air Force to cover its ass and also save a teacher 's job look Martin it be over let us not make a thing out of this Lightman 's behind this be not he no he be not I do not believe you

just hope for all our sake you know what you be do join the club six of the juror look convinced Clara be guilty just from the opening argument you could see approval on their face every time the prosecutor talk maybe but these two be for the defense and they 've already emerge as leader Jurors 6 7 and 11 be look at they gage their reaction which way you two lean maybe he be not die fast enough for her the guy be 30 year old than she be so so it can affect the power dynamic Imbalance of power in a relationship can lead to victimization that strike a nerve that be interesting study

discover his corpse Dr Lightman in your expert opinion do this claim of memory loss pass the sniff test could you elaborate it be be prove that some trauma warfare child abuse can cause memory loss an experience with such case yeah Plenty I 've work with soldier rape victim memory loss be cause by degradation or abuse Shock of a dead spouse that would be a first how about a shock of commit murder

without show any sign of deception so Clara reject Damien for his father who be shadow he live in it could have drive he to murder we need to get Damien back in here now that be dangerous you think I need more prep work before I testify there be a few more technique Dr Lightman want to go over anything for my father you slut that be pure science how be it all right come on Damien you lie you be

Clara do not kill her husband right I see you switch side how can I compete with leg cleavage associate you can not you must be cleavage Legs here be twice the lawyer you be ever go to be you know

it be go to be a long time before you get any business from my office I be devastate really I will see you in there counselor you bet that be interesting what he be not worried at all about Damien he do not give a toss about I come over to the other side if anything he be more confident than usual he be up to something why do you hire a private investigator to look into Clara 's past I would be friend with Victor since we be 10 year old in catechism at St Bernard 's when I realize Victor be get serious about Clara I want to make sure her intention be sincere as a friend first and as a business partner and do the investigator find anything criminal she reinvent herself though new name new hair color new resume break with the past be not always easy to your knowledge be Victor happy in his marriage yes but he do not have all the fact review the estate yesterday I discover something objection any information he have about the estate should have be bring forth in deposition be you certain that you make the discovery yesterday yes I be certain no he be lie your honor he be be sit on it so have the DA that be absurd your honor I move to clear the whole gallery muzzle your ex Ms Landau or I will proceed with your finding when I look at Victor 's sub account I discover monthly withdrawal of roughly 90 000 Spread across the last year and a half Clara be steal from he he be not lie Motion for recess your honor I need time to research these claim you can recall the witness when prosecution rest Ms Landau you be leave that jury 's 12 to nothing to convict you be screw if Clara steal money from her husband why do we switch side Lightman screw up Foster always say the close you be to someone emotionally the hard it be to get a true read yeah but Clara be a strange Zoe be not anything she touch Lightman be go to bring baggage to it speak of baggage you want to unload some of your own like that memory that Lightman see what what kind of age difference be we talk about here 10 year we be not discuss this do you violate state law Decency law it be a totally legal and healthy relationship that be exciting come on give I something what be you hide at least give I his name Denise Watson Tanya Wilson as I live and breathe Clara 's good mate why be she so angry with you then I do not know that she be really how long have you two be friend do not have to talk that be true that be true but I will see to that while you explain to a jury why you get so scared when Leo testify that Clara be steal from her husband I be scared for Clara as a friend be you two in it together be your rob the old man blind as I be go through a tough time Clara be help I out see there be that fear again I think you be hide something I think you be here just to make sure she keep her mouth shut Ridiculous I smell blackmail of a sexual variety what be it be it you and Clara you and Victor wait Three be a crowd right you and Victor and Clara what you get on he you get photo you get video you get dirty knicker I have nothing to do with his death my money be on video I think you get a sex tape about 90 grand a month 's worth Clara meet he through I her life be suppose to be mine it be

when you nip out to pay off Tanya yeah it be mean to stop but when I get there she say that the payment be go to keep go you could not tell your husband or your lawyer it would have confirm what people have be say and his reputation mean the world to he you be willing to go to jail to preserve that reputation true love I know it be absolute insanity I be innocent Zoe and I think maybe you could somehow make the jury see that speak of the jury we 've be read they and they be 12 to nothing to convict it be one thing to say you be innocent but you got to show they who be guilty we know we can rule out Damien who else have access to your house the only other person with a key be Leo he just smear you in court I be steal he stand to benefit financially if you be convict he be the executor of the estate there be no way Vic and Leo be more than business partner they be like brother so be Brutus and Caesar Put I back on the stand again what just ask Loker so you sleep with woman too you just go to a whole new level of blunt well it have serious ramification my competition may have just double I be curious ok Denise be funny and interesting and I like her smile I do not make a life choice right so just to confirm not bisexual then it be experiment Loker and you know why can girl do it and guy can not where be the fantasy in that Anyways who really care what people do in

in spite of fear son you know what Sod this all right I mean really what happen behind the red door what happen over there stay over there really not for he clearly it do not do he or anyone else any good to keep go over it anyone else you get someone particular in mind have you look at he you think this be help enough he do not have a gun and even if I do I do not want to kill you put the gun

question with as much accuracy as you can I be comfortable in this glass box a man in your position correct up in the poll Survivor of an assassination attempt I would never exploit a tragedy like this for a bullet bump now I say it so you do not have to you be way off base Dr Lightman so I have to ask why all the guilt governor a girl die look more like fear to I what you frighten of someone try to kill I at that rally but a girl die instead what be her name Michelle Daly Separation of first and last name the personal with the formal so she be not just any old girl to you be she governor and do not tell I that all depend on what my definition of be ' be she be one of our college volunteer it be no secret she know I how well would you say you know she hardly at all we might 've make small talk might 've could 've be more than that it be not Declarative commanding you want to make sure it be never more than just small talk you sure it be not pillow talk absolutely not clarify language Defensive there be a misunderstanding that could 've be misconstrue wire be cross Governor man to man right and Foster here Michelle be a beautiful woman now I know what it be like to work with beautiful woman he be talk about your friend Clara Musso yeah and her we both know that there be woman out there that be naturally attract to power Governor out with it there be one night a few month ago I have just win the primary Alcohol be flow and I would have a few drink it have be a rough campaign my wife have head home early that seem like the night in question Michelle and I wound up smoke a cigarette together share it she compliment I on my win we talk for a long time steal away like that it make I feel young it be innocent but not to Michelle she be confused that my wife have leave early and here be the governor enjoy the taste of a young woman 's lipstick on the filter of a cigarette we both know that this be not about a confusion of a young woman anymore do not we you have sex with her that night admit it it be one of those moment everyone celebrate schmoozing and here she be show I such simple sure yeah you take advantage of she do not you nothing happen yet you be ashamed why be that Trevor Addison walk in before I could do anything I would regret if he have not he and I decide then to distance Michelle from I he reassign she why keep she around at all I be not about to cut a promising career short just because I almost could have cross the line your future president 's more lucky than good he do not cheat he have no reason to kill she could we just leave he alone now he be explain his action but not the other who work on his behalf he be a governor Gillian not a mob boss that sound like a much well campaign slogan than no more excuse I do not do it Corey come on man they find your gun right there on the scene when they take you down you be catch red hand I be tell you it be not mine so what be you say it be a conspiracy to frame you for the murder of Michelle Daly I do not kill she you do not mean to kill she because you be aim for the governor right there what you do with your nostril that tell I that you want governor Brooks dead I do not shoot that girl and that gun be not mine stop lie I be not I be innocent I believe he that be fear of this place same as his what Corey do not do this he say that he do though to his cellmate which by the way why do you say that Corey they think twice about rape cold blooded killer in here and you really believe that he do not do this I know he do not take we back to the night of the primary no messenger on that in person get a signature thank you the night of the primary when you find the governor celebrate privately with Michelle yeah that night of the primary I handle the situation speak with she and find she a more suitable position one chat with you and she be out of the inner circle it be my job to insulate the governor very smooth hence the strut or be that just like a side effect of be around all this office Totty so how long do it take you to get Michelle in the sack then I be a single man Dr Lightman I work 100 hour week Michelle be a beautiful young woman neither of you have ever be tempt to mix business with pleasure excuse I but the woman you be sleep with be kill on your campaign trail you do not seem too shake up by that I cut Michelle 's family a check for funeral expense that be nice of you for the terrible day ahead if you do not mind see that clock over there 19 hour until the poll open and count I 've get a question for you you know the man that be arrest for the shooting right how do a nutter like that get through your security I like a man who can own up to his own mistake he cut a check now you think Addison have Michelle kill he use to be a lobbyist for security contractor so Addison 's sleeping with Michelle and let us say for whatever reason he want to have she kill why do it in such a public way it be two bird with one bullet Michelle 's a goner and Brooks be a winner he get one of his black op buddy to do the job no one be the wise it be absurd cal he be not that kind of man so what kind of a man be he exactly he be try it on with you have not he please eye front Clara this be important have not he I can not say as I blame he really excuse I that be suppose to be a compliment Compliment that be funny it feel more like an insult he be a player Women like Michelle be just a number to he woman like Michelle and I no because you turn he down right see I tell you I be good at this I do not think that Michelle be the only woman that he be poll on the campaign trail Brooks have ton of woman work for it Let us not start a witch hunt Witch hunt be that what you call they Lemmings all right who here apart from Michelle Daly have be shag the chief of staff Bingo Lady in pink what make you suspect that Michelle and Addison be also have an affair she go from part time volunteer to pay staff come out of nowhere you see the advantage of sleep with Addison you know how the game 's play but Michelle be not a game player Michelle be wholesome what mean she be naive and innocent she wear a promise ring plan on save herself for whatever whatever say with an edge of contempt she be a good person see you have to control every muscle in your body from your head to your toe to pull that one off it be true I do not doubt it I be talk about the anger you feel for she as if she be to blame for you be here in the hot seat with we how do Addison get a promise ring off a girl like that we all partie just as hard as we work she want to fit in she start off with just the occasional small glass of wine and then the wine turn to spirit it be ok we all make mistake Michelle be a grown woman an adult I do not make she drink I do not steer she towards Trevor Addison you be do everything you can to avoid the elephant in the room be not you Elephant in the room why a promising young woman be murder they be shoot at the governor you be a cop now be you they have to shoot past the governor to get to Michelle let us treat it as murder for now see there it be again fear and anger I would feel the same way if I feel I be be force into a lie I have not lie Smart true too technically because you know how to steer a conversation and you know how to lie by omission I smell a cover up I 've be there I 've do that I be not involve I hear thing but I do not do anything now what you be do be stonewall you 've go from gossip to accomplice after Michelle start sleep with Addison she start drink even more at the commonwealth fundraiser last month she got totally bomb and she threaten to go public with the affair Addison send she home before she could make a scene and she drive up a curb where a man be collect bottle and can say she do not even realize she hit someone at first so it be a hit and run Addison make she turn herself in and then it just and I have no direct knowledge of a cover up but I be guess Addison get the incident sweep under the rug and the man she hit he die after a few day a drunk staffer kill someone lead up to election you make it go away in a close election you want more than that you want the girl to go away right you know a couple of my agent find your little hideout the gun Ammunition plus the crosshair you draw on Brooks 's photo speak to malicious intent I buy those to protect the governor Brooks be in danger I would have to agree with you on that you do not understand I send the e mail so staffer would tighten up security they be not real Brooks he need a guardian someone like I let I explain something to you you can try and play crazy for the jury that be not go to fly in here from your collection what the hell he do not recognize the murder weapon hey this should be in an evidence room can you playback there instant genuine surprise he be never see it before because it be not mine do he want Brooks dead yes be he dangerous you bet he be delusional he think he be get a special relationship with the governor the gun be a throwaway it be easy to file number off a handgun anybody could have plant it near Corey the guy be a patsy he be here on gun charge so he be go to have to sit tight till we can figure this thing out whoever kill Michelle could have know about Corey 's threat make sure he have a clear path to Brooks for shoot so they could pin it on a Wacko just a minute oh hang on hello so do he send you over here to appeal to my well judgment no he do not that be good 'cause I 've do everything that be what I tell he you hungry oh you

no emotional reaction do not that make he a sociopath or it be just a mask where be he I know he be here Dr Lightman 's at a meeting across town can I help you Mr Wilkie Dr Lightman lie back when he say Jason commit that crime you turn Jason in to the authority because I think he might be involve somehow Dr Lightman be the one who say he be sure he be the one who convince the jury to put my brother on death row the fact of this case have not change the call be happen again I see it on the news the real killer be still alive and Jason be dead now and what have I do Sir why do not we go sit down no listen you tell Lightman that I be sue his ass and the state of Virginia in the wrongful death of my brother Faye we get this whole system set up so when your home phone ring it will ring here as well which will keep I out of your hair if another call come in do not panic ok just stick with the script that Dr Foster 's write out for you Let us rehearse again be that he hello Mrs Sheridan it be Noah Benson it be my son 's roommate Noah be everything all right an FBI agent be here look for Oliver he be still not here yet and no one know where he be so Oliver be audition for the man of Fincher college calendar we find a schedule on his computer he have an appointment with a photographer this afternoon which may have be the last person to have see he what be not you tell I Ben there be people at headquarters that do not think you should be involve in this case why because it be too personal or because they think I 've lose my marble or that I 've already make a mistake and get an innocent man execute they do not say that but you do right there I be not the enemy here really really prove it Oliver Sheridan be here for about 30 minute do you have any idea where he go none see I be expect lad in varsity jacket not meat and 2 veg yeah well that be what sell yeah Fair enough so where be your picture of Oliver then it be on the second shelf red folder I be on a deadline here right no no no no he be dress like an eskimo here where be your calendar pic just 'cause a guy be good looking do not mean camera 's go to love he so how do he handle this rejection then he be disappoint but he take it well you can not open that without a search warrant really I tell you what if you be not ashamed of anything in there you can call the cop yeah do not think so just stop he what do you got there young beach stud Fraternity fun 21 and hot it be research all right I win you owe I 10 buck see whenever anyone say uh it be for research I win if they say that be not mine then he win so cough up there you go thank you I think that this calendar thing I think it be just an excuse for you to get young man naked in your apartment I run a business really what be the matter with your leg what you hear I nothing Jeez God Liar let us look at it I fall see I think you get fresh with Oliver he reject you you get angry and violent so what happen do you kill he he be the one who get violent I rub his shoulder and he hit I with a golf club and leave do you know where he be go that be a no come on you be fish for a job why because Jack Rader 's make it clear that he appreciate my research that I be welcome there and I have the most leverage with he now Let us face it this ship be sink so the rat flee News of Lightman 's mistake be already out there and once this lawsuit be file this company be finish even if we win it will be too late Lightman 's reputation'll be destroy Ours'll be damage alongside it what about what about loyalty the way Lightman insult I on a daily basis blind loyalty would just be self loathe and the good time to look for a job be when you already have one I need you to pull up Jason Wilkie 's final word the pied piper be a rat catcher who be trick and do not get pay he steal the child of Hamelin so the rich would remember the day I do not take little Rex the pied piper do there be theory that the pied piper be the symbol of death that the fairy tale be concoct to explain the tragedy where child die any news about Oliver Sheridan he be unaccounted for but that do not definitely mean he be be kidnap you do not believe that do you expect we to just share this delusion that Lightman be infallible that Wilkie might not have be innocent without Lightman you would be in some university basement do research and you would still be a glorify baggage handler maybe instead of polish up your resume you want to think about what you can do to help Lightman Zoe Cal 's not here actually I come to talk to you I be worried about Cal he seem to be handle thing in his own unique way he will not even speak to I about the case he will not even return my phone call I be hope you could talk to he Gillian you be the only one who could always get through that be funny I always think that about you the truth be there be probably only one person that can reach he I can fly over the moon I can fly over the moon ok I can swim under the sea the only one I tell my secret to be Beth my poodle right what be go on nothing so Foster send you over here to check on I do she yeah she and mom you tell they I be fine actually I need to talk to you about mom she be be act depressed lately just different well she be but she be a strong woman she will get through it I know what be go on that it have to do with that Wilkie guy who be execute yeah she think we might have make a mistake he might be innocent well be he I do not know we can rule out the homeless man and the phone repairman base on the old video but we be still look at the school bus driver and the phone company supervisor the problem with these suspect be lack of motive whoever do this be probably a rave lunatic anyway so I find something in Wilkie 's old interview right he be try to sound crazy because he be try to get off on an insanity plea but when he say he only tell his secret to his poodle Beth he be not fake it he have an ex girlfriend her name be Beth Lansford I think maybe he tell his secret to her Beth 's the key any idea where she be I speak to her mum she sign into a psychiatric hospital 2 day ago which be a bit of a coincidence let I give it to you straight 'cause you do not seem to get it nobody care about Wilkie 's dog or his ex girlfriend excuse I you be off this case and this come from the top that be the Sheridan home phone you might wanna
