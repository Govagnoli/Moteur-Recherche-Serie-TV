go to need to put some hostage on the stand will any of they testify on your behalf I do not know what about the Jones girl Felicia be it what about she I hear she visit you last night Juries love

've try I do not remember call a staff meeting no I I be just uh pitch some of my new idea to everybody really and what be those really well all right for starter um a paper free internet base system that track insurance claim in real time Paper free yeah now we would have some cash outlay for computer hardware up front but it would pay for itself in increase efficiency not to mention save we from from drown in pointless triplicate form do not leave out the most important part Egan yes good thank you yeah it would keep sick people from have to haggle for their money all day when they should be worried about their treatment well I think it be a great idea Egan except for one small problem okay what be that the inefficiency as you call it be how we make our profit without it you be out of a job which you will all be anyway if you do not get back to work and Egan yeah you get any more appearance I should know about because I need you here on time he be just a jerk it be fine just an idea hey it be taco Tuesday at the cafeteria you down I will be there in a minute Saline I need suction okay that do it for the atrial wall superior and inferior vena cavaes and the pulmonary artery we will fix the aorta prep the paddle and get this baby hum let I have a 4 0 prolene I say a 4 0 Terry this be an aortic anastomosis not your stitch and bitch group guess some people never change and this plan of yours this be at what point in the standoff about halfway through it after reese have kill the security guard and it be clear that negotiation be go nowhere I just want to make clear that Nick offehimself as a sole hostage he have Reese and Dalton convince that they be go to make it out of there this plan would 've work right now about the security guard be it true that you have an opportunity to get he out but that your mother be release now that be protocol Monica the man be wound he be conscious and alert Dalton would not have allow it anyway by the way the real question be why negotiation break down so badly that Nick have to be the one to deal with it on the inside hello Monica Good to see you Deputee District Attorney Nick Kathryn can I borrow you for a second yeah sure excuse I what be you do here wall have ear Kat the question be what be you do here help a friend help he do what make our case against Dalton and Reese more difficult by cast the cop as bad guy say that the cop on the outside screw up should not hurt your case if you do your job right but I appreciate your concern for your career well it might do you some good to think about your own look if you side with he you will alienate everyone in the L A p D and the FBI not to mention quite a few people in your own office and you can certainly kiss any political aspiration you have good bye that will be go they be go to throw he to the wolf I do not have a choice look I know what you go through together no I do not think you do Kat hey I understand you feel you owe he in some way okay but do you even have any idea what you be get into with this guy who he be be there something we should all be talk about Nick no no it be all right Kathryn we may as well get everything out in the open here right Nick I be all ear I be just wonder if you bother tell she about your past what about it well maybe about your gambling problem the one that blow a huge case for your department and put other cop at risk the one that land you on probation and get you his close to getting toss out on your ass now you think Monica Turner do not know about that be not go to lead with that in a story like this I think she be go to lead with what be relevant my past have nonothe to do with anything well I think that be a little naive you do what you get to do but I would appreciate it if you would let I know either way gambling problem I 've get an ex wife too she be not go to say nice thing about I next time you want I to go out on a limb with you you well be straight with I I be sorry where be we be you

I I ask the nurse to tell he I want to talk to he and he refuse to let I in what be you try to do I do not know I just he be go to die and I have all these feeling and I just think that we be go to get the chance to face he in court in front of the world and now it be like he know that like he be let himself die to punish we I think death be too good for that bastard I be look forward to see he squirm in court rot in jail for the next 50 year nothing we can do about it anyway so should not we just try to you know look forward amen to that well that be not exactly true what that there be nothing to be do Most of the time when a a patient be noncompliant they can be turn around right usually they be just act out to get attention but who know with he what if he could be sway what be we do here well would we prefer that he live and face the music or float away high as a kite on morphine I for one would like to see he suffer some more and we all know the thing that he fear the most be go back to jail well I would like to see he off the planet as soon as possible I agree with Nick if he die tomorrow throw a party move on but what about Lucas he should not have to stand trial by himself no he should not Lucas make his bed when he bring that psychopath in there I do not even know what we be talk about here this be out of our hand it be god 's will now God 's will you think

Nick Yo Bet to you in or out I be in the preliminary hearing be just a first step a judge will hear a brief version of the evidence from a police officer and decide whether the case should go to trial which it will why hold it now in the hospital why not just wait and do it in court we ask for a postponement but the defense object if the defense do not agree to the delay we have to hold the hearing within ten day of the arraignment well why do they object because Lucas ' lawyer be a shark there be go to be a lot of press at the hearing and he want picture of Lucas look weak and sick to build sympathy for he for the potential jury pool at least that be what I assume it be that be why we need you all at the hospital on the day of the hearing so you want we to testify no we just need you to show up talk to the press have your picture take look this be not a case about a bank robbery or hostage take this be about the killing of two people Eva Rios and Tom Mitchell now they should be here and they be not we need you there to stand for they to remind people who this be all for Carlos Vega I be Kathryn Hale I be with the L A D A 's office I arrange your transfer to Lancaster at the request of Franny Rios you get I move I do well then I owe you one a big one must be a relief to be out of Chino I be guess you be getting squeeze pretty bad oh yeah guy want serious cash yeah like I have an a T m machine in there tell I what be Randall Reese like in Corcoran I do not know he no Nah Knew of he mm hmm he hang with skinhead and guy like he and guy like I we do not really uh we do not really get together you know what I mean it be just such a coincidence 12 month after you and Randall be in Corcoran he and your ex girlfriend end up in the same bank robbery hey well I would not know about that unless it be not a coincidence what be you get at lady it be hard not to connect the dot Carlos Eva the bank Randall you whoa whoa whoa you try to stick this on I no I be just try to figure out what happen like be you ask for money from Eva before the bank robbery okay yeah I be ask she for money but I have nothing to do with that bank robbery all I know about that be Randall be there and the mother of my child be kill you 've get three month leave to do right yeah if I find any communication between you and Randall Reese I mean anything at all I be go to make it my job to make sure you spend the rest of your life in jail I get nothing to say to you you be seriously suggest Eva be involve in the robbery you and I both know that a lot of bank job have someone inside they come in Smart Lucas and Randall they take out the security camera they know what the back entrance be yes they do their homework Homework they have help Eva fit the profile a low pay employee someone not in the bank long enough to develop a real loyalty except to her sister who be also in there Eva have a criminal record a bogus auto theft charge when she be 19 maybe but we know that Carlos be pressure she for money and I find out that Carlos and Randall do time in Corcoran together where do you get that Ed so I go to talk to Carlos and what do he have to say nothing the minute that I ask he about the bank he clam up you be a d a you be talk about felony homicide of course he clam up Randall always treat Eva differently until he shoot she well maybe he shoot she because she snap maybe she be in over her head and that be why she be freak out so much why be you do this you do not think this be hard for I I be try to help franny and then Ed find out about Carlos and Randall I vouch for Eva and now I be on the hook what if I be wrong how much do we really know about her enough to know she would not be involve in this she be break and live in her sister 's apartment I 've see people do bad for a lot less money than be in that bank and so have you if you be think like a cop Nick you would say that we should pursue this why do not you bring this to I before because I know how you feel about she and I just I want to have something solid well you do not and you should leave this alone my lawyer tell I not to speak with you Mine tell I the same thing can we talk anyway

have to apologize I mean look we go through this thing we sleep together once you do not owe I anything you know we be not in a relationship and right now I actually have to go to work I understand that the company have to protect its interest sir but Tom Mitchell literally give his life for the bank I be aware of our responsibility to the shareholder sir but we yes but I understand no thank you for speak to I this late Mr Babbage well they take she to court Judith might win she will never see a penny oh you do not know that and Judith have lawyer to look out for her you do not have to look honey can we please go you know if we be late they be not go to seat we until intermission wait a minute wait we meet the chairman at that M S fund raiser do not we Malcolm let it go I can not do that yes you can and you need to look do you know how long it be be since we have a talk that be not about this place you know deal with the police and hire new employee and now this lawsuit you do not understand okay I be their main witness they be go to be use I against Judith now how can I just let that happen Honey look I know that you feel helpless in here there be thing that you do not see thing that you could not control Malcolm but be this really the way to make up for it Ed Ed so do everything go okay last night at grandma 's yeah she sing I a song she say she use to sing it for mama it be nice over at grandma 's be not it with that big yard yeah and some kid from next door come over one of them say next time I go I can ride his bike Ricky you know how much I love you right sure aunt Franny okay I just want to say it I be all right I be not hurt what be he say to you say just now uh I I do not know Kathryn Hale you know that thing we be talk about before yes do you find out anything else as a matter of fact you want to hear yeah Eva buy plane ticket to Phoenix for herself and Ricky one way the flight be the day after the robbery where do you get that I can not tell you wow all right I will look into it Bye sorry to keep you wait Mary Malcolm what be up why the call well I have be do some research for the lawsuit and uh I dig up a few thing I think we should discuss what kind of research this be an e mail that I send last may 17 ask corporate to consider instal bulletproof glass for the teller and metal detector at the entrance to improve security and this be the reply refuse that request because corporate want to project a homey and invite image I guess bulletproof glass and metal detector do not exactly say home what be you do Malcolm this be another e mail send last september 23 ask that our security camera system be update from analog to digital and this be the refusal from corporate too expensive Malcolm you do not want to do this this one 's pertinent it be my proposal that we double the number of guard on duty at closing time since that be when most robbery occur again refuse by corporate too expensive so you be blackmail the bank I just think it be important that corporate behave responsibly this be a mistake Malcolm Kathryn Hale she move the ticket what do you mean she move the date of the flight three time in the four week before the robbery it be a classic tell for someone on the inside the date of the job keep change so they keep change the getaway date so what do we do hey what be up we need to talk to you about Eva so we think there be a possibility that Eva be involve in the robbery maybe she help Randall and Lucas plan it you be kid right oh my god no hear we out no no way we find her criminal record you mean that thing when she be 19 I do not she be arrest because Celia Castro live with we for six month and Celia be crazy Celia get everybody in trouble that be the only bad thing Eva do in her whole life you really believe this you look we all know that Carlos be pressure she for money Carlos be always ask she for money you do not think she ' rob a bank for it do you Franny we be tell you this because if there be anything to this we need to know if the press or a lawyer get ahold of this it will be bad for everyone how could you think this she buy a one way ticket to leave town the day after the robbery so she be plan on live with our cousin in Phoenix she do not think L A be work out she move it three time Franny it be 100 buck every time you rebook I know what that kind of money mean to her be you go to tell I she change it for fun you really want to know why she change that ticket yeah really it be because of you Nick she change her travel plan because of I she keep on hope that something be go to happen with you so she change her ticket just wait for you to ask she out oh come on I tell she she be an idiot but you keep on come in give she hope there you be uh oh sorry to interrupt um it be start what be he say he be tell the judge what be at the scene and what we say in our statement be not that Hearsay I think they could not do that at trial they can not but in a prelim hear Hearsay be admissible he be do and in ten minute the judge will rule and this will be over can not be too soon be you all right what be happen Kathryn Randall 's atorney have call Felicia to the stand what no absolutely not I can not prevent it it be Randall 's right to question a witness how could you let he do this we object the judge be give he the leeway then we be walk out of here that would be contempt of court the judge would issue warrant for your arrest I do not want to do this why do not you tell we this could happen because he know we would not show up if he do Mr Jones I will do everything I can to limit the question I do not want she question at all for god 's sake the girl do not even remember what happen I be afraid that do not matter Miss Jones I want to ask you about what happen in the bank I can not tell you I do not remember except for the first few minute so I 've be tell you have amnesia you can not remember anything no no uh so you do not remember Mr Dalton 's very affectionate treatment of you no look this be garbage stop it Mr Dalton uh you remember thing since the robbery though you remember what you do last week say yes then you remember go to visit Mr Dalton in jail three week ago because the uh the visitor log say that you do your honor I ask again the relevance here I will tell you Mr Reese my brother be try to blame all this on I he set this whole thing up and now he be try to set I up again by turn all these people against I you be full of it go ahead and ask she Mr Reese Mr Dalton either one of you speak again I will have you gag Miss Jones you have to answer the question um could somebody repe it please do you remember go to see Mr Dalton in jail yes and why do you go to see he I go because I feel connect to he Connected yes like like maybe he have save I from what from he in the end the system do what it be suppose to do and that be hold Randall Reese and Lucas Dalton over for trial now I will take your question right here right here Dana I be wrong about Eva yeah if Eva be involve Randall would 've say so today no way he would not play that card sorry forget it you get in the car I be take her home hold hold on one second um all right you need to pay more attention to your family Malcolm hi why do you keep on come here do you really need to ask yes you say that I do not owe you anything but I do not think

Kathryn really think that Eva have something to do with the robbery Franny tell I yes but I do not know why I ever believe it well I think it would make it easier cope if you think she be responsible
