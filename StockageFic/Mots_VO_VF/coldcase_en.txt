right Lilly you be right someone do beat the crap out of Jill on a regular basis but it be not I her father be a real son of a bitch you sure know how to find people I think you would still be live in Chestnut Hill I like the city do you find something autopsy record and medical record and I just do not understand these injury Jill have before she die Injuries Broken rib when she be 12 a concussion a jaw fracture at nine year old what be the deal she play field hockey and soccer uh huh she be very active Evelyn my ex husband be a mean drunk I know the difference between a soccer injury and a trip down the stair do your husband beat your daughter he be in Houston the night she die that be not my question he be be dead nine year and now you work at a Shelter for batter woman and child where do you get that the case file I take this picture I do not see how you can just forget her Evelyn Forget I think about she every day this ruin my life then it still matter I can not look back it be too hard so you sell your Chestnut Hill house pack up your old life and and think you can just walk away you can not walk away from her Eveylyn she be a part of you there be now hope now and what if you do not solve it where do that leave I what if I do solve it my husband do not want I talk to you Todd do not want you help with your good friend 's murder investigation I think we put this to rest it be important to I Melly so you come to the party with Jill but leave alone I drink too much I have to go home and I could not find she you make a big point in your interview that you be sure it be not Todd the detective make a big point of ask about he he be fixate on the Whitleys but barely look at Tim Dorn this be the cook he live in our guest house and he be with the girl that night when we leave for the party he tell Jill she should come by later if she want when I hear she be miss the next day Tim be the first person I think of all this information and I get one page on the guy the mother and good friend think do it you got to listen to the good friend teenage girl tell each other everything well Britt write two sentence on he then blow he off it be hard to tell if he even work he hard enough especially when he have it out for Todd Dorn be up in Frackville lock up why do you think he be go to talk to you I be an optimist Lil I get a wife at home you do not have to come you think it be a dead case let I just call she five year for forgery I get a facility for it get I into trouble you ever dabble in more serious crime like the violence do to Jill Shelby no Ma'am I be strictly a cerebral criminal pretty attractive be not she she be pretty cute for a girl you do tell she to come over that night she come over a lot to get high she and her little vixen friend Melanie well that little vixen think that you kill Jill well if you marry the prime suspect I guess you well point to someone else Jill 's mom also think you do it a woman live in a certain world if the shine neighbor boy kill her daughter that world 's a lie Britt have your alibi down here as go to bed at 10 00 I guess he must have keep his word actually I be with a friend that night what friend Bobby Jordan this big luscious college boy down the street neither of we be exactly out and proud at the time so we ask Britt not to document the sleepover Bobby 's go to confirm that well I imagine he be come to term by now do Jill ever talk to you about Todd oh sure those girl tell I everything like what teenage drama they even tell I thing they do not tell each other like all the while Jill be fret that Todd do not treat she right Melanie be do he on the side you can not be here Gate be open my partner Chris Lassing how you do Todd be furious at you uh oh thank to you his brother come here last night drunk after six year of be sober Eric do look I 've tell you about Tim Dorn why do you have to keep bother we Dorn 's alibi check out we know about you and Todd step out on Jill back then I I do not have to talk to you we have to arrest you you do not want that Lady you should see our hold cell your headband will get all dirty why do this matter 'cause when you tell we one lie Melanie even if

what a patriotic street walker it be in Seventeen why do you have to be a jerk why do not you go and comfort her you know you could use some time in charm school could I I could give you a tutorial upstairs what about Jill what about she I be obviously not proud of it it sound like Eric have pretty strong feeling for Jill so so why have he fall off the wagon just 'cause Jill 's name come up two million people in this city I get to run into you you think I be thrilled see you all right look I be sorry if I be obnoxious in your office More than obnoxious it be just the way that you be look out

that to protect he okay let us say I be with Melanie that night you can understand why I would not want the entire world know that right right so why not just say that you be sleep why give Eric an alibi you should drop this Eric do it that be why you can sleep at night and have a normal life and he be a mess you should just watch it when do the hard drinking start after he kill she I can make your life very difficult Eric kill Jill you clean up after he Brother 's keeper ever since be I close tell I something Lilly what be the point of all of this after so many year People should not be

well please tell I he be not in trouble wish I could thank for your time so she outgrow the guy he be still pine for she all these year later Most people get over this stuff she leave he three year ago grandma die 14 year ago but I still do not get why he be reach out today where you head due in court Drop by social security for I uh not my favorite joint what do you need well it take five year before the court declare Krystal Hogan dead and six year before James collect the life insurance so in the meantime you think he be pick up her benefit check easy scam to pull off Sherry say grandma have some cash float around so what about Krystal 's bank record already put out a subpoena all right rush yeah remember when I run James through NCIC PCIC yeah he be clean yeah well I get his social I run he again get an assault charge why do not it show up early he be not charge under the name James Hogan he be charge under the name James Gable Gable half brother to the victim Lonnie Gable so he have some family after all I do not know if Lonnie 's go to see it that way what do James do to he beat on he with a brick James be use your last name 'cause I buy he his first car I tell he not to do that sound like you look out for he he be my little brother so how do he end up alone with Krystal I be in Baltimore work for a mortgage company when Mom die in that wreck I come back I do not wanna move in I 've get a life but I tell he to get live in help for her he do not wanna do that I could not force he she be his grandma not mine actually he and the old girl get along pretty good he always say how much he like his talk with her I live nearby I figure I could look over his shoulder but then you two have that fall out he be beg for I to meet Sherry you be not too high on her I have they over for a barbecue she be nice whatever then suddenly she say that she want this certain wine cooler so James go on a run for the next 20 minute this girl go on parade flirting prance bend over real intentional show I the world I just look away whatever and then she say will I take she away to New York it be such a sideways thing to say I just laugh and she follow it up with whatever you want wherever you want for the rest of your life so then what happen I get she the hell out of my yard James come back I figure I well tell he before she start lie so we sit on this back stoop then I be fix up you can guess the rest he open you up pretty good so why do you pull back on press charge what be I go to send he to jail I figure it be good just to walk away and not look back the shocking thing be he be really fond of Krystal Krystal 's benefit check be 812 a month good bank for a 19 year old and they flow in long after her death these here be date before the murder that be Krystal 's signature the rest be date after she die I know that writing see the little tail on both S 's Mm hmm do Sherry endorse these check well let I send it over to Questioned Documents thank what if Sherry orchestrate this the fraud or the murder or both so you be say Lonnie 's story be start to ring true well these check show she be no angel and if James get on so well with grandma the way Lonnie say

life and my career back as far as the phone call 's concern Holly insist that I call she on her birthday say if I do not she be go to call I so what you say your wife know about the affair know about it in the back of your mind and hear a girl 's voice on the line they be two differnt thing Holly tell her dad she break thing off with you in April but you be still go strong in May you would tell your dad the truth about your sex life what be all that two hundred and twenty eight article on Roy Minard Murderer the President 's Award for Outstanding Lecturer why can not they put that on the news People like a story you be a postmodernist a what well that be the crux of the theory anyway social construction of reality what be you talk about Society need a narrative you know give seemingly random fact and event we need to weave they into a story otherwise the world would not make any sense I can see that how do we process this beautiful young girl die we can not not without a perpetrator and so if one be not obvious we find one we assign the blame it make the story complete it be an action explanation order restore why people got to believe in God too mm hmm exactly too many unanswerable without he make some sense well I would be even more fascinated if I be not the foil of it all but yes it do it make some sense Kite uh office be close Rush seven o'clock yeah well

knowledgeable huh yeah I know someone where be Lil ask a warrant for Barry 's to find the hooker 's belly re those letter to Holly maybe he start own up all right good night Scotty yeah so Roy Minard

that to anyone we can get a search warrant for what an old man 's knickknack a dead man 's diary Pierce keep a diary after the fire at Baylor 's milk Pierce refer to something call the fifth day in his diary the fifth day mention it a bunch of time do not you dare put that in your mouth I like cheez whiz on my cheesesteak so what fifth day sound like some sort of group Pierce start guy from the

cat anyway good call I when you hear from Fisk I mean Sure get anything in criminal record long rap sheet on Pierce Assaults on male and female all black victim claim they be attack by a group of young white male african american history museum have a listing of hate group in ' 39 they list the Fifth day as one in Philly White supremacist take their name from the Fifth day of creation God say let we make man in our image and let he rule over all the earth mean the white man of course Mission be to terrorize black come up from the south look for job every Fifth day they would go on a rampage beat up some black person for the crime of be alive murder part of their game could be check it out the Fifth day Meet Pierce and our friend Jonesy Jonesy do not look burn could have they where the sun do not shine Museum do not have last name on these clown Id'd they here only by their moniker or first name we will keep look Lilly still with the ADA our handwriting expert come back with a profile of the letter writer it be a kid only child in the boarding house be the owner 's daughter ten year old at the time of the murder I will go pick up Lil this be miss Sadie 's favorite room my mother take in boarder during the depression I hear this place be a bed and breakfast now owner say it be okay for we to come in bring you back to your old home I be glad no one tear it down do you write Sadie 's letter here I write they yes but the word be hers her baby girl mean the whole world to her do you remember write about a milkman who might hurt Sadie Jonesy I remember he well why because of what Sadie find in the milk show she who be boss here be your milk nothing but poor white milkman trash who he think he be trashy old poor white milkman trash leave a note miss Sadie Shush girl what be this say he say forgive I Crazy white trash he be say he be sorry I still say he trash that be not nothing but tinder for the fire go on Arletta throw it in wait write something for I why should I because you be a lady I forgive you they what be your name my name be Sadie those note go on and on for month right till she die why do she think Jonesy would hurt she I think it be her heart she mean do they exchange note the day she be kill Jonesy want she to meet he here that night for a proper visit Miss Sadie keep each and every note hide they behind the stove where no one would look and no one ever find they why not because I take they still have they too I be raise by other people Sadie do not even know my own folk Jonesy be an orphan maybe check the child 's home in the area look for his name I will care for your little girl even if she be not my own because she be like I every child deserve to be love he want to make a life with she and take her kid in too a real 180 from the Fifth day so be Sadie kill by the man who hate she or the man who love her Pierce or Jonesy maybe something happen that night at the boarding house that turn the tide of Jonesy 's love Love can turn on a dime we know a candy man do you love I Sadie or do you love the candy man Blanche 's husband Blanche and I we just start date and I uh have a little crush on Sadie do not you do this to I Manross we can talk somewhere else if that would make it easy I be young foolish thought I could have my cake and eat it too Sadie never go for it because she be involve with Jonesy so you know about the affair not till the night she be kill they hide it well you have to back then if anyone find out one of they would be dead one of they be dead so how have you find out the night of Sadie 's murder we be all suppose to meet up at the juke joint I think Sadie be go to be there but she she be not so I go down to the boarding house to get she we get to go tonight Sadie we can not just go but we talk about this we be just go to visit that be what you say in your note I know but something come up what look you got to leave with I right now I already get the ticket the train leave in a half hour we go now and we could make it Sadie I want to but why be it get to be tonight what be wrong Jonesy I go back to the juke joint never see she again Sadie be ask for trouble take up with that half blind white boy what do you mean half blind could not see out of one eye on account of the fire why do not you ever tell anyone what you see that night because I do not want to hurt the woman I love but I do anyway Manross volunteer his dna fingerprint shirt off his back you really think this guy be the doer sometimes jealousy beat out love and hate hand down what I do not get be Jonesy be just go to visit Sadie that night but then something happen and he be frantic to get out of town something like what Pierce find out his white supremacist pal fall in love with a black woman threaten revenge on they both get our milkman Nathan jones just his name but it be a start grow up in a boy ' home in Philly run he through autotrack DMV even military record get a thousand and one hit back Manross say Jonesy be injure in the fire go half blind later if he apply for military duty he would have be reject right wait a sec my old man go through this a class 4f rejection Unacceptable for military duty make he feel like he have to wear a dunce cap back in the day so we check Nathan jones with 4F record then maybe we finally nail down this son of a bitch hey rush hi how have it go Judge Fisk K O'd the motion to exhume what not enough probable cause we 've get three possible doer here Kite look it be an ancient case okay and the bottom line be cold cash we do not have

even if she be not my own he want to take care of her and your mother I wish she have have a chance to see this to to know this your mom I be sorry it be okay I have some bad news too Sarah the D A 's office do not grant the motion to exhume but I be the family do not I have a say it be not that they need more of a reason to do it solve my grandmother 's murder be not a good enough reason it be complicated financially difficult I will pay for it Sarah an exhumation and autopsy cost at least 10 000 I 've memorize all of her letter these past few day I feel as if I 've come as close to meet my

I might be able to collect some scraping valen you be kid where all right jeffrie and Vera find Jonesy he be still alive and kick it in New York city detective the index finger of the right hand I think maybe we 've get something maybe Sadie 's speak from the grave lab 's try Pierce 's dna from his granddaughter manros ' too 1950 's ticket train to New York that be go on the cheap take SEPTA

with young eye can read the lettering on that bus Fernwood Home for orphan Sisters Vivian Dole and Grace Ashley run the Fernwood Home in 1958 they still get orphanage in Philly no we get the outstanding foster care system instead Nuns what about they tough lady at least the one who teach I I be afraid Sister Grace die recently I be sorry she give 50 year to the Church that be a life well live you and she run the Fernwood Orphanage in 1958 from ' 52 to ' 70 we have up to 60 boy and girl at any give time you must know these boy then they look like Fernwood child but I could not tell you the name how about a boy name Arnold remember he wear a cowboy hat it be possible I see so many child come and go I just I do not remember they all do you hear about the Boy in the Box case back in ' 58 I do not think so Kid be dump in Fox Chase it be all over the city we lead private life here we read morning prayer not morning paper we know the orphanage be go now but there must be record from Fernwood somewhere I believe they be all in the basement but I be sure you do not want to sift through all that actually we love that kind of thing well you be welcome to look there be one Arnold at Fernwood that year Arnold Culliver six year old so the Boy in the Box have a name we have intake and adoption record for he who adopt he Rubin and Lila Hanson April 4 two day before he be find in that field he be well off at the orphanage those parent get a lot to explain we will track they down I want to meet these people Arnold come to Fernwood in ' 53 with a sister Gretchen can we find she there be a Gretchen Culliver list in uh Roxborough Working in the city library you get the name of those other kid at Fernwood we can figure out who the rest of these boy be maybe if the sister give her dna we exhume the boy 's body make a positive I D we be go to need an ADA 's help on this one huh you know anyone want to go talk to Gretchen sure thing Arnold Culliver be my brother but this be not he I know it be hard to look at well that be not my brother Arnold have curl blonde curl be he one of these boy Gretchen yes that be he with his Science Club friend where have you get that someone leave it along with this circular well that dead boy can not be Arnold he be adopt in 1958 Sister Vivian say there be a family come that want a little boy they can not have I I wish they want a girl too I will not go Gretch you have to even if we get separate you know our plan right Meet at the horse when my 18th birthday go to the Bryer Horse Fair meet you at the horse do not forget I be not leave you Gretch but he be go one morning adopt late the night before I never say good bye to he do uh you go look for he at the horse fair I do actually he do not show it be a lucky Arnold find a home he act up a lot there be two family before this one who have take he and bring he back because of his behavior and if you get too old you do not get adopt at all you be stick at Fernwood that what happen to you yeah I grow up there any idea where Arnold go to live oh they never tell we thing like that I always imagine he with a nice family on a horse farm somewhere so nice he forget Fernwood he be very young when he leave Gretchen would you be willing to give we a dna sample so we can compare it to this boy 's well I would be glad to but I know that be not my brother I would offer a refreshment but we do not get much in the house no problem so what be it all about we get your name from Gretchen Culliver Roger from the Fernwood Home Gretchen be she one of the old girl yeah her brother Arnold he be your age oh sure that be the Science Club gang that Arnold be a cut up yeah Leader of the pack you know drive the sister bark mad we will make a posse find that old girl and bring she on in I get the rope Freddy get your spur on Got'em Sheriff what do you think you be do we be go to the wood Bedtime be an hour ago we be go to lasso a cow Sister Vivian there be no cow in the wood that be what you think yeah he be kind of the holy terror of Fernwood so of course uh well we all love he why be you ask about he we be work a homicide from 1958 we think the victim be probably Arnold oh no could you look at a picture for we do you think that might be Arnold Arnold have blonde hair curl and if his hair be cut off I could not say yes but I could not say no I get two boy adopt hey anything off that suitcase just that it be buy at Wannamaker 's in ' 54 only the big department store in the city that be before credit card so no record no print on it either we get the okay from the orphan 's court to exhume the boy be his sister go to give we a swab she be pretty committed to this boy not be Arnold boss she well get uncommitted blonde curl or not that be the same kid find any of the other boy in the photo two other be dead besides Arnold one we just talk to yeah say Arnold be a problem child if two different family take he in then change their mind he must have be so Lila and Rubin bring he home he throw a fit right off Rubin give he a paddling or shake he too hard he end up dead well what else do you do with a dead kid besides dump he in a field maybe there be a reason they be hard to trace you can not find they no record of they anywhere in Pennsylvenia we be try the national database now Nut job 12 o'clock must be our rabbit guy good luck detective Rush and Valens Walter Rafferty I be the one to find that boy in the box thank for come in you have something new on the case possibly he be about six year old wrap in a blue blanket it be 12 00 noon on Sunday and I follow a jackrabbit into the brush and I come upon a box a a a Liho Punch box and there be the boy inside you do not recognize he no absolutely not you be not involve with he die absolutely not I take a polygraph test in 1958 we know you do I will take one right now I give the cop a straight story you do any investigate yourself as a matter of fact I go back to the site every year on April 6 and I be not the only one there be a woman who go out there too I I see she there for year yeah we 've get that down here she come with white rose wear a green plaid coat you ever talk to this woman I try a few time she do not want to engage why be this whole boy in the Box thing so big in your life Walter I guess you 've see lot of dead body do not bother you well I be not build that way this this derail I I wish I never see that rabbit I think this Walter guy be on the level boss just gotten mess up by find the body what do you think of his story about the lady in the plaid coat 50 50 even if it be true what be it mean she could just be an obssessive like he how long you think this will take one of your girl wait for you what I would not give to take a look at Scotty 's black book you know what forget it I can go tomorrow do not want to miss the show huh we finally find record on Rubin and Lila Hanson and well there be a reason they be so hard to find they die in the 1887 Arnold 's parent do not exist Rubin and Lila Hanson die before the trun of the century bury at the cemetery at St Emilian 's the same church where the suitcase turn up so the adoption paper be phony so what happen to Arnold the night he be supposedly adopt maybe he die in the orphanage someone on the inside cover it up with adoption record here be another layer Autopsy of our boy positively I D have he as Arnold Culliver from dental record but uh Arnold 's dna do not match Gretchen 's so they be not brother and sister then Arnold 's intake paper be doctor too so this kid come from nowhere and go nowhere who sign these record Sister Vivian and guess who be not talk now Sister Vivian in seclusion Nun on the run ever stake out a convent I will go anywhere Gretchen 's go to take this hard yeah how do we tell she that not only do her brother die 46 year ago but on top of that he be not actually her brother this must be a mistake no no I be sorry Arnold and I come to Fernwood together our parent be kill in a train wreck you do not have the same parent Gretchen Sisters Vivian and Grace know about this I think they must have and they keep it a secret from I all this time you be young maybe they be protect you Gretchen we know now that Arnold be never adopt there be no family that come and take he away and right around that time someone hurt he bad enough it kill he the good explanation right now be that he die at Fernwood we need your help think about who could have hurt he I do not know be anyone ever violent with Arnold Freddy Baker he be in that picture you have he beat Arnold up pretty bad once who else Arnold got discipline a lot by who Sister Vivian why be you back I do not like that family and they do not like I they kick you out I run there be no one to play with well Arnold what do you have to say for yourself Good to be home you be pleased with yourself be you do not hurt Arnold 's come to my office do not Sister Vivian I never know what she do to he in her office but he come out with a lot of bruise would Sister Grace punish he too it be always Sister Vivian you ask Freddy Baker he end up in her office a lot too Fernwood ahhh bad memory the bad sorry to bring it up but it be a homicide investigation who die boy name Arnold Culliver Arnold Crap that be one of the few kid I like the way I hear it Fred you be kind of a bully at Fernwood yeah I would run around drop guy for look at I funny real nice kid you know you ever drop Arnold one time but mostly I just leave he alone 'cause he have spirit you know give the nun hell he be popular huh with the kid yeah funny thing about he he love it at Fernwood everyone else want to get out he keep come back what be your memory of Sister Vivian mean old battle ax she be the reason I keep my kid out of catholic school she ever whale on you enough to do damage sure she be sadistic so you think she could have hurt Arnold bad enough to kill he be you say Arnold die at Fernwood we do not know yet I think he got adopt no Sister Vivian be pretty cruel but murder it might have be accidental I will tell you it get pretty bad I still get scar on my back from where she take the belt to I she use a belt huh with I she mix it up Spoons paddle have a lot of trick in her bag I be sorry as hell that kid die Sister Vivian you be a hard lady to get to I be in seclusion it will only take a few minute I be not comfortable with this you know I be not comfortable with a few thing myself like Arnold 's phony intake paper and his phony adoption record I do not know anything about that and the fact that his suppose parent die in the 1800 I be also uncomfortable with what I be hear about the corporal punishment you give out at Fernwood Raising Children call for discipline oh you be extra rough with Arnold Culliver he have a serious behavior problem oh now you remember he because before you could not place he at all yes I remember Arnold he be a troubled boy and you just do not feel like tell I and my partner that before we lead private life here and I believe in discretion I do not like pry eye because they might discover what you do I do not do anything out of the ordinary to those child you leave kid with lifelong scar maybe it sound scandalous today but it be routine in 1958 Mm so maybe in a routine pummeling of Arnold one night he fall unconscious from one of your blow die in fact you would want to be discreet about that event so maybe you cut off those blonde curl so no one recognize he put he in a box and privately take he to a field and dump he that be a remarkable thing to say to a woman of God be it true no why do you fake Arnold 's intake and adoption record I do not your signature be on both set of paper Sister Grace do the paperwork and I as the senior sister at Fernwood sign the document be Sister Grace as fond of corporal punishment as you be I will not speak ill of the dead why do she fake the record why do she do any of the stupid thing that she do Sister Grace be a screwup she be weak willed and she be unreliable and she could not discipline the child and that be why I have to what be your name he be Arnold do you like swim Arnold I like horse Afraid we do not have any of those but we do have a membership at the Haverford swimming pool do that sound like fun Pow pow pow pow do not socialize with the parent so much I be sorry Arnold just shove a woman I tell he good behavior we have to control he Grace he will never get a home if we do not could Grace have hurt Arnold Grace some story should not be tell Vivian claim Grace be the one to doctor the record be she offer a reason why she be mysterious about her and conveniently Grace be dead how have it go with Fred the bully he be a decent guy adopt twin from Romania do he do in Arnold Nah but he confirm Sister Vivian be good and vicious find the last kid in the photo it be Paul Evans he add anything to the picture More of the same Loved Arnold terrify of Sister Vivian one thing strike we though he say he could not have kid yeah first guy we find Roger he adopt his kid Fred adopt too that be what we mean three out of the six boy on that photo do not or can not have kid maybe orphan be more likely to adopt when they grow up three out of six Lil that be a cluster not a coincidence Gretchen say this be a picture of the Science Club boy right right maybe we need to find out what they do at this club uh the boy go to the Science Club on Fridays while the rest of we have music class Science Club be not at Fernwood no they go someplace else so take that bus by themselves Sister Grace go with they you know what they do there no it be only for boy and you do not know where it be no but I think that picture you have be take wherever the club be hold be it that building 's not Fernwood maybe we blow this up Science Club be um just a weekly field trip to where a hospital type building what kind of thing do you do there it be different every time could you give we a for instance one time we have a breakfast in the afternoon hello Doctor Sister Grace hello boy do we have to give blood today Dr Thayer no today all you have to do be eat cornflake we just have lunch I hope you be hungry it be fun nothing scary about it do you know Dr Thayer 's first name Nah sorry Roger we have to ask you a personal question okay do you adopt kid because you could not have your own yeah that be your side not your wife 's how have you know that all three man still alive from Science Club confirm as sterile how you go to blame that on cornflake I do not know and I do not know what it be get to do with Arnold 's head wound either we get to find out what else be go on in this place Lil get a partial name on the building uh h o something I n something Something Institute Hoover Institute in Fairmount so let us look for anyone who work there in ' 58 start with Dr Thayer uh I get some Lil okay you know what I can go tomorrow you 've be say that all week Scotty but you never go yeah I will meet you in the morning Scotty first thing first thing all right you want I to auto track Thayer uh maybe let I boss no I get to learn how to run this computer sometime Lil be it on sorry I be late the bus be park right over there we know what be go on here in the ' 50 Government research Dr Milton Thayer be use volunteer include the boy from Fernwood as test group what be Fernwood get in return they be pay a fee for every boy they bring over I get the contract Sister Vivian set this up no Sister Grace what kind of test be we talk that be what we get to ask Dr Thayer he be an emeritus researcher here yeah I remember the Fernwood boy they be subject in a series of radiation test for we Radiation right we hear something about cornflake that be one of the method how would that work the milk be irradiate you give radioactive milk to six year old boy very low level we also put it in the toothphaste and have they brush their tooth with it this be government sponsor you be what 30 year old yeah so you do not remember the Cold War what about it we live in fear of the bomb Radiation research be consider necessary it be even patriotic do you know your test leave three man sterile we do not intend to harm anyone but at the time we be work for a cause so you do not regret the test we work within the boundary of what we know back in the ' 50 's we think those test would do we good we also perform lobotomy which we now think be barbaric but at the time it be consider cut edge medicine uh huh can not help the time you live in so Sister Grace arrange the visit to the Institute think she know what she be do to these kid she be a nun not a doctor and back in ' 58 the culture be doctor could do no wrong you do not question they you do not question the government either they fund the test be look into what else be go on at the Hoover Institute in ' 58 a lot of behavioral research what be that mean try to straighten out psychotic by way of insulin treatment isolation tank electroshock oh God tell I they do not test that on the orphan that would explain Arnold 's head wound I auto track an ancient nurse use to work in Behavior still in Philly Sally Thurber old lady now kick it in a retirement community I remember that boy in the Box case I never put it together with Fernwood no one do those boy be darling do you know any of they maybe they be research subject oh not for we no I just see they around the Institute in their little gray uniform I would talk to the nun who bring they sometimes Sister Grace she would come down to Behavior once in a while yeah why would she do that well I suppose everyone be dead now so I can speak out of school please she would come visit Clayton an assistant in our lab a medical student and they be friendly Friendly how well more friendly than a nun should be with a young man in my opinion he be a good boy at heart but he act up you look beautiful Grace Shh I can not tell you that Clay he need a family I be worried he will not get one if he do not change he will outgrow it no it be get bad please help he I do not know what you want I to do the treatment you give the patient here that be not for child do it work it be very effective calm they down right right I know it could help he Grace there be an adoption party tomorrow please for I Clay do you ever see the boy they be talk about that same night I be leave I see grace again with that little boy in tow where be they go I assume to see Clayton to get that treatment she ask for what be that treatment ECT shock treatment I remember that night because that be the only time I ever see Grace out of her habit I never even know she have blonde hair what be she wear that night a plaid coat a green plaid coat sound like Sister Grace and Clayton be some kind of item and he know how to administer ect which be suppose to control wild behavior and she want a boy control for an adoption party there be a party at Fernwood on April 5 the day before Arnold be find so maybe on April 4 Grace and Arnold secretely come to the Institute she be wear lie clothe so no one recognize she except for Sally the busybody she be in a green plaid coat just like the woman our Rabbit Guy see in that field over the year probably Grace and before you give shock treatment you cut off the patient 's hair Grace have the same coat all those year how many coat do a nun have why do she go to such length for this kid when she be get 60 kid who need help yeah why Arnold Sally make it sound like Grace and Clayton have a relationship yeah we still do not know who Arnold 's parent be and why Grace doctor those intake record that be sacrilegious Lil she be a nun she be also human we can talk here you probably do not want the sister overhear this conversation what be it now we think we know who Arnold 's mother be I do not want to tell the story of Grace I know you do not but a little boy die Vivian her little boy Grace be not a good nun no kidding she be dreamy Weak she have good intention she just do not have self control do you know Clayton Waters he be Grace 's ruin she be in love with he till the day she die when she be 18 she come to I and tell I she be pregnant I probably should have just tell Mother Superior but instead I help she go away for a few month you and Grace be close like blood sister she promise to leave the baby at a Pittsburgh orphanage but she just could not and so she bring he back to Fernwood and slip he in as Gretchen 's brother he become our cross to bear misbehave all the time could not hold on to a family and he be get old less adoptable do he know Grace be his mother we never tell he but I think a part of he know that he be home with Grace that be why he keep come back so what happen to Arnold on April 4 oh April 4 well on April 4 Grace be desperate to find he a home right before I tell you the rest I want you to know that everything Grace do she do because she love he Vivian Vivian what be you wear Arnold 's sick what in the world happen Clayton treat he to help he behave you be not suppose to see Clayton we have to cut his hair off his beautiful hair do Clayton say he would be sick like this he say he might feel tired but Vivian he be get such a fever we have to pray for he I think it would help he would behave and then some couple would want he and keep he say a prayer Grace it be suppose to calm he to control he Grace never dream it would be harmful do Arnold make it to the adoption party no no his fever get bad we be out of punch Sister Vivian Mm th there be a new box in the kitchen where be Arnold he will be down soon go talk to people he be go Vivian I will meet you oh Arnold I hope you know I love you I will meet you at the horse what be you

to those people I be not upset about it that be not what Renee say she say you want to get marry that be what you be suppose to say if you get a girl in trouble so you do not want to marry her no excuse I and you be for the abortion I do not want to get involve then why be you at the meeting place the day Renee go for the procedure she see your truck Charlie look this be 35 year later my wife no one be talk to your wife I follow Renee see she meet those hippie and I tail the car to West Philly where be Renee be cool man Shut that door she in here no no this be a private home you can not just crash in here I be go to call the cop no no you do not wanna do that but look at you you be just a kid how old be you Seventeen you want a baby at 18 and a wife before your senior prom look how about some air brother I cry on that hippie 's shoulder for ten minute then what nothing Home where be you two hour later that day home with anyone yeah my mom she be go now that be too bad Charlie 'cause those hippie go miss that day look I do not want Renee to do it but in retrospect it be the right thing for I do you realize that before or after they die Lil Scotty we get the FBI file on Jane what they have a file and they give it up it be public record now we get name of informant no they draw the line there but we do get these yeah surveillance photo of the Jane volunteer Julia and Gerard pick up and drop off woman April through June of ' 69 this your young renee that be her then this be the day they disappear someone else be there someone who take these photo and give they to the Feds an informant that nut case Lionel be right Lionel think Gerard be a snitch Gerard do not take these so who do Informants sound off the wall sound date our case be date there be always rumor like that look like a parlor game at the commune try to decide who the snitch be Weird it be a paranoid time well it seem there be someone watch Julia then I guess it be not paranoia so in the parlor game who would you suspect it be not a suspicion intuition Adam and Julia be non monogamous he tell we and I have first hand knowledge of that yes grant I be sort of trip at the time it be so fragile can I take its picture these be great I be document the movement yeah I be go to do a book someday tell the story I love this one of Julia yeah have any of I I will take some right now how about a rich Jersey girl bed penniless draft dodger the camera be pretty sophisticated for a guy like he it come into my mind for a second but I be so flattered that he consider I part of the movement I put it out again he ever put out that book Boss we get some yeah we too Adam Clarke burn his draft card in ' 69 he tell we about that Problem be Adam should not have have a draft card in ' 69 we check his military record he be already serve Vietnam ' 66 to ' 67 really when Adam get home it get more interesting he cross state line drive a peace van load with weed arrest for drug sale Thought he be too disorganized for that the case should have buy he state time but then the feds take over jurisdiction Poof Case go away he make a deal with they become a CI stay in the movement keep we inform now those photo he have of Julia really make sense black and White long lens Adam Clarke ' 60 babe magnet star of the anti war movement and FBI informant that would be big news big bad news and if Julia find out there be your motive for murder do you mind not at all I know why you be here Lilly yeah I be an informant fot the FBI in 1969 go on my old case agent call give I a head up question be be ask they do not give we name I know and when you tell I about Julia and Gerard I I hope that my background be irrelevant but it may not be I be surveille they the day they disappear June 3 1969 7 20 a m yeah this guy 's name be Charlie Rinzler I I know who he be be be that all you have of he oh he be so agitated I report it to my case agent the Feds run his license have I follow he for a week but nothing much come of it so you have photo of Charlie from the week after Julia and Gerard go miss yeah but nothing too exciting can I see they anyway I basically follow he every day for a week to and from work he be a day worker in construction can I take these they be yours if I can ask a favor if we can keep your secret we will you work construction back in the 60 huh Charl yeah couple of summer remember a job at the Calvin Building summer of ' 69 put down the foundation maybe 'cause that just happen to be where Julia and Gerard be dump the same week you work there it be an amazing coincidence Mm too amazing that that can not be right this be you at the construction site Charlie who the hell take that good luck you have that foundation be be lay just when you need to stash two dead hippie I never hurt they that guy be nice to I long as that building be up you figure you be home free too bad they want a parking lot there now it be coincidence that be all I guess I need a lawyer Update for you Forensics be back on the hair find with the body and it be not Julia 's so there be someone else at the scene with long brown hair Charlie he be Nixon youth Crew cut how about Adam Clarke Long yeah but a lot of people have long hair back then and Adam come clean about be an informant FBI be not go to confirm put himself in harm 's way unless he practice what he preach People who win face the real fact of whatever situation they be in maybe he look at the odd know we would make he as the informant with or without confirmation so he step out ahead of we make himself look good and set up Charlie audacious action with the element of surprise will give you the upper hand we know Adam follow Charlie around for a week he see where he work could 've dump the body there one night which point right to Charlie if anything ever come to light and Adam get 35 year to have a life till his luck run out we get enough to compel a dna sample I mean this guy be not go to give it up he already do those picture they be real helpful Adam I be glad you be an excellent photographer composition frame especially frame how have it go down anyway you get sloppy that day Julia and Gerard catch you I do not follow Charlie do not kill they good try though I never say he do Adam Clarke real hippie or poser real my passion be very real how would you like have long hair all they strand blow around and guess what Adam one of they blow right into the plastic bag you wrap your friend in Got stick under the tape a long brown hair that do not belong to either of they you think I be the only guy with long hair those two be in contact with well the dna on this will confirm it whether you be a real hippie or not do not matter your long hair get you in the end why would you do it Adam be you against what Jane be do I think they be heroic I do not want Julia or Gerard to be harm but then they find out about you pretty soon the whole movement would know you be a snitch for the FBI the Feds have I I have no option how about take responsibility be not that the winner 's way I be a leader in the revolution we be live like it mean something I love that life could not stand to give it up ever wonder if Julia and Gerard feel that way think they love their life Hey Jules Gerard what be you guy do here what be go on Adam you take our picture I be always take picture yeah what 8 00 in the morning on a deserted corner I I do not get this oh man this be sad he be a snitch come on Adam Clarke who well this be crazy right let us let us get in the car Adam just do it Jules the

Brown you well watch your mouth man hey what the hell 's problem Herman do not want to win tonight that be crap 'cause his bookie Big Ed Brown he own Herman that be not true coach come on then why have he offer I 500 buck to join you in mess the game do not you lie Billy it be the truth he be on the take you go to talk about Herman like that you be off this team Coach you be off this team he would say anything to take down to Herman Attitude problem three year run nothing to his allegation Herman win the game for we shake four guy and dunk on a seven footer end of story okay end of story oh boy he miss a bunny that be like three in a row ' 87 State Championship yeah Herman 's last night on earth he turn the ball over again okay and now here be the end okay freeze it Scotty now he just win the championship and everyone else be go wild but look at Herman Nothing maybe he agree to throw the game but in the end could not do it that would explain why he be not smile and maybe why he got

not sell so I pay a visit to the Berkenpass kid how would that go down it do not and with no insurance I decide to sit that game out but the way Herman play it seem like Freddie do have he on a string all I know be when it be over Freddie still owe I money that must have have he run scared sure but he slow down maybe you 've notice Freddie do not walk so good no more you get some riding on this Friday 's game Freddie what do you mean try to keep Ray out of play so you can score some bet just like you try to score off his dad in ' 87 what now we know you ask Herman to throw the game the night he die come on now if I do that why do they win huh Logic Freddie just 'cause they win do not mean you do not ask he I be in full support of Herman 's career but you owe the money to Big Ed Brown I pay Big Ed late that be why you get your knee break but first you try to fix the Tech game to cash in on it 'cause you do not want your knee break who do I talk to Big Ed he tell I you promise Herman would lose that game why do not you say so at the top huh the truth Freddie it be not my proudest moment Herman this be a one time and one time only thing now I can not believe you be ask I this you think I wanna be ask I be embarrassed man I can hardly look you in the eye can not you work this out with big Ed this be work it out do not you get that he be go to hurt I for keep man understand Freddie listen Herman you be go to have everything in this life man the good Lord do not give I the talent he give you that be okay I make do but I be ask you this once toss this dog a bone no I can not do it I be sorry no but when Herman play so bad that night it look he might come through for you after all give you hope during the whole game right up to the buzzer that must have piss you off no no no ungrateful kid will not step up for the man who be a father figure to he so maybe you be the one who lower the boom on Herman that be an outrage you say that what be wrong Ray 's missing could Ray have skip out on practice no no no Ray do not miss practice he come early leave late always maybe he just go somewhere to clear his head you think Billy have he I be go to go see Billy right now

intent coach come along part of a package deal turn out if Ray decide to go to a certain college Coach Lein benefit big so be coach aim to take the same ride on Herman 's back 17 year ago and how badly do he want it maybe the gambling angle be not the answer do Herman ever say where he be go to school no one know there be a new rumor every day Kansas Iowa Duke she would probably know sorry boss do not let this change the investigation thank you for find he Sure Tanya have Herman make a decision about where he be go to college Temple he be go to announce it the next day the Owls head coach be John Chaney he be always run a clean program he do not to do favor so maybe Coach want Herman to go somewhere else where they do do favor Coach want he down in Florida Temple 's not the place

will give they a call right after you disinfect the phone Greg be not drunk that night he be sick Sick how well we do not know it be off and on for about a month but he feel good that day until we get to the bar what kind of symptom he have Headache Nausea why it be possible Greg collapse on the street before he got hit by the car from what do he have any kind of chronic condition no he be a health nut he jog every day he play hockey with Gary you know Gary be sick that day too same symptom I think so where be Gary now yeah I be sick too Headache nausea same as your dad what be that have to do with he getting hit his health that night might have be a factor anything else you remember about your symptom I think I be see thing kind of yellow what do you mean like like there be a yellow filter over everything I see so you and your dad share any of the same food that day Dad eat something that mom cook and uh I have fast food how about chip or pretzel watch the game no but there be something else we share hey there he be good scrimmage yeah sorry about this morning Gare that be all right I be well today how about tomorrow we set up the net in the driveway yeah cool because your mom love when we slam puck against the garage I do love it very much anyone need anything no thank honey no thank hey hey hey Gary what be do you know well sorry you get a few year to go there kid maybe I get sick from drink from the same glass maybe so Mel and your mom be both mad that you touch that margarita I do not see what the big deal be it be only a sip Father and son drink the same margarita both fall sick Susan and Mel be both there both could have slip something into the drink and they take big pain to stop the kid from drink because dad be the target fast forward four year and the widow and good friend be marry maybe they be see each other decide to get rid of Greg I want find Mel 's ex see if she suspect an affair Visitor at least there be good news for someone why do not you go talk to Mel Scotty man to man hi Tami thank for come in you have news it be not you oh that be great you be sure someone confess to hit Greg cardiff that night and there be an eyewitness to back the story I confess to what you think you do what about the blood the damage to my car maybe an animal maybe you do hit someone injure they but we only have homicide record here Point be you do not kill anyone do you want it to be you Tami I quit drinking because I think I hit this guy that be keep I in check now I now what I really want a gin and tonic we be think food poisoning and that he just fall in front of this car I 've see strange thing oh crap you okay there Mel knock the wind out of your sail when you hear something like that he be my good friend yeah how have he get the food poisoning maybe the margarita he be drink really Gary say he take a sip of his dad 's drink that day and you kind of swat it out of his hand I might have how come he be only 14 I mean he be still not old enough to drink can I ask you an aside here sure I be not judge believe I you and Susan you really take up after Greg 's death yeah because I know if I be you and I be look at she and she be interested back I mean married or not the flesh be weak maybe it make I a real geek but no I be faithful well well man than I so uh the margarita you remember who make they roll rock huh you guy be really live it up or it remind we of our college day would not you rather have a margarita Mel oh no I do not drink tequila ever since hell night freshman year Mel do 15 shot in 15 minute I still get sick thinking about it you end up in student health for three day my parent almost sue the fraternity I be uh good with this so Susan make the margarita and the margarita make Greg sick I do not like what you be suggest just add up the fact look I will say it again there be no love triangle before Greg die would your ex wife back that up Sure Jill be the one who leave I for another man Know where we can find Jill no we be out of touch who be the doctor she end up with Michael something Jill leave you for this guy and you never get his name look if your wife tell you that she be screw another guy that be really all you need to know anything else be just salt in the wound find Jill davis or at least her answer machine Good because Mel be either a great liar or do not have nothing to do with this well someone definitely want Greg cardiff dead get something from the coroner no tissue sample but Greg be an organ donor Transplant unit at Pennsylvania hospital have some blood sample store lethal level of digoxin what be that Medication use to stabilize an irregular heart beat and it can be deadly if you want it to be Overdose symptom be nausea headache yellow tint vision Gary 's symptom and faint maybe why Greg drop in the street Guess who be in the emergency room who Mel davis exact same symptom as Greg we find digoxin in his system I do not know what digoxin be Prescription drug but you use it wrong it be just poison well I 've never hear of it all that cook and cater you do Susie be pretty easy to slip a few lethal drop into dinner every night I have to get to the hospital be you tired of Mel be that it what he be good to you and all just like Greg maybe you just have your fill of he I love Mel you know about black widow they be beautiful but deadly destroy their mate when their usefulness be over I do not hurt my husband you got to be more specific Susie which husband do you mean the one already dead or the one in the hospital if I be unhappy with Mel why would not I just get a divorce I do not know maybe you just do not like confrontation yellow tint vision it be weird huh they be run a million test where have you have your last meal home something Susan make so Mel there be a drug call digoxin in Greg 's system a lethal amount what be that a heart medication I think they be go to find that in your system too your partner 's already be down this road with I Susan would not harm I and she never would have hurt Greg she adore he maybe she adore you more at least for a while it be always he Greg be plan a I be just the one she settle for but the fact remain Mel you have the same symptom as Greg you know the name of her business Cardiff cater she still use his name that be how loyal she be to he hi boss Jill 's there go ahead I will be there in ten you talk about my Jill yeah we track she down want I to give she a message no no message Mel always have it bad for Susan even when you be married to he I do not like to think so but you know in your gut it be the reason why we break up I think you leave he for a cardiologist only because I do not feel like wait around for the affair be there an affair no Susan would never leave Greg be not until after he die that Mel see his opening oh yeah two day after the funeral he want I to draw up paper not too subtle no so Jill you be marry to a heart doctor you probably know what digoxin be yeah I take it I meet my husband because of my heart condition Hospital confirm Mel be poison with digoxin just like Greg probably no surprise to Susie here and turn out Mel 's ex wife have be take that drug her whole life you think Jill do something Jill 's over Mel she have a new husband and she never have anything against Greg but Mel on the other hand Mel have real good access to digoxin over the year do Mel and Greg eat a lot of meal together go out drink they be good friend accord to Jill Mel have big plan for you soon as Greg get out of the picture who else could it have be Susie oh no you remember something I think he be just be a friend but even on the day of the funeral Mel be move in I see a guy get a ticket on my way to the cemetery and I just do not understand Understand what how the world keep go I mean how do people do mundane thing like write up a ticket when everything be over hey Baby I be sorry I be sorry it be not over you be go to be happy again the three of we be all go to stick together we be all go to be happy the three of we when he be still married to Jill but why would Mel make himself sick he never think Greg 's poisoning would come out know it would he get desperate try to set you up Susie Hospital just call Mel davis skip out Driver remove the key from the ignition throw the key out of the window now track he through his cell phone he be not respond to order so what be he do fugitive do not usually think before they run my guess be he be think now can I try Mel this be detective Rush show we your hand please put your hand outside the window he get a

from Vanessa 's pocket compare this two Dobie 's architect write Vanessa a love letter they almost match almost this be call letter you look at any set of plan it basically look like this all

asthma attack do Vanessa ever mention the name Marvin Dobie Ex con from redd no bell redd um she take a bus to redd a few day before the election she say why I hear she on the phone checking schedule when I ask she about about it she change the subject Darren Clemen call Dobie in Redding end up dead Vanessa go to redd probably to contact Dobie same end all road lead to redd Congressman 's hometown

Vanessa he lie about Dobie you find a connection yeah pull the form to see who post bail on Dobie 's arrest Fraud ' 77 5000 dollar bond post by Linda Savis who be that get her own record for prostitution but only once under that name in her married year she be know as Linda Lake Mother of David and Abbey what do she have to do with Dobie share an address for an year probably a boyfriend so Dobie do not live in the same neighborhood with David Lake he live in the same house and Lake can not place the name which be doubly curious consider the check he be be write Marvin Dobie have be get payment from a trust since the late eighty a trust set up by David Lake have the congressman give Dobie a financial support but what be Dobie give he you say you do not know Darren Clemen or

the night he be kill Ian Vicky ask I to the movie but I have an early shift the next day so I stay in not much of an alibi but it be God 's honest truth we will look in to it of course you have any

knock it right off Easy there get out Easy I be just try to help it be a little too late for that too late God can not you see you be make it bad act like somebody die she do not die she be right here Vicky do not tell we about that I should not have say anything the guy lose his wife early those kid be all he have of course he be mess up the father a violent guy never know he that way but Vick and he stop talk as soon as she move out why be that all she say about it be the accident make he a different guy Mrs McAllen I hear the message on the machine that they be look for you we be just ask he

hey Uncle will Mr Stillman Hey Leonard look good out there son if I could only hit the dang ball oh the hit will come you 've get the mechanic I do what 've I be tell you still I be no Clyde Taylor Let us get you home who be Clyde Taylor you 've never hear of he no he be the good of the good maybe even well than Babe Ruth right that be what my pop use to tell I take the old negro league by storm but not for very long because somebody kill he right that be true who no one ever know not even the police sometimes there be no good evidence the police have to put the case away and we be leave with just mystery but what if it be the Babe who got murder I mean instead of Clyde would the olden day cop let that be a mystery Clyde Taylor 20 beat to death next to his car outside Connie Mack Stadium well no return to the scene of the crime the stadium be tear down in the 70 's body be find after an exhibition game between the negro league all Stars and a group of major leaguer they find he still in his uniform assign have down there be a smear in front of his jersey yeah a tobacco stain the backside be cake in blood well the story went Clyde be attack from behind strike down with his very own bat which add up his gear bag and mitt be find next to he the bat be miss 40 's different era ball player lug around their own gear might explain why Clyde have his uniform on Colored player probably be not allow to shower Suspects they be look at Tyler Cage the lose pitcher the one Clyde hit a home run off to win the game the player hear he jaw at Clyde use racial slur but ultimately he have an alibi post game press conference have not even start Cage be see across town drink away his post game blue locate the last to see yeah Mr Joe Crumbly go by Crumbs Mr crumbly you be the club house manager for Clyde 's team the Philly Steel Drivers check also on board for the All Star game the day Clyde be kill you two be the last one out of the locker room Check Clyde want to avoid the spotlight so he wait for the mob to die down Hammers a homer and then like to lay low yeah that be how he be so I pick up the slack be the braggadocio one see I believe Clyde have he live would have be the first to cross the color line not Jackie Robinson so go back you remember if Clyde be carry a bat with he that night make sure he have it in his bag it be the bat he hit the home run with a home run off of Tyler Cage the oppose pitcher yes ma'am what be your opinion of he the man be low than oil dirt ask I who kill Clyde my money be on he because of the popping off he do during the game Racewise what be say during the game be never an issue but off the field well that be a different story hey Mr Taylor could I have your autograph what be your name young fella Troy ok Troy Best of luck to you son Gee thank now when I go to the toilet I will have something to use hey you little bastard get back here I recogize you the bat boy so you be the pitcher 's son let I have he keep your cotton pickin ' hand off I ya big ape what be you go to do hit a kid I would like my name back I be tellin ' my dad you be go to be sorry you do not keep your paw to yourself boy Rotten to the core just like his pa never tell the police this story never figure it mean much just another jerk kid be a jerk how be it you become involved with what be an all black organization I know Clyde since the war see he play ball with the other serviceman then we be home I hear the local negro team be holdin ' tryout so I ring he up Next Clyde make the team and tell I I be comin ' along with he Troy we know about that stunt you pull on Clyde after the game ask for his autograph so so we also know you run and tell your daddy he put his hand on you that do not mean dad go back and do something about it he be dead 10 year let he rest in peace well that game end his career that give he motive he have an alibi so maybe people lie for he look you know the history a white pitcher who lose to a black team in 1945 may have just pitch himself out of baseball your dad must 've hate Clyde not as much as Moody do who be Moody Moody Brown the player Clyde replace on the line up that day well how do you know about that when you be 7 year old be the bat boy be like be a cat 's ass down on the field up close and personal hear what the player be really talk about be you say you see something go down between Moody and Clyde have the good seat in the house Best not be thinkin ' about nothing but handin ' over that ball real nice Mister what be that scar on your face ask around see what you hear hey you stop right there just hear I be not playin ' because of you I be in the line up I do not know do not worry rookie we be fine we all in this together right because we only get one day one day tommorrow those major leaguer go back to be the boy of summer we go back to be the boy who shine their shoe I would not look at it that way look here what d'ya say you pull up a lame for old Moody one time huh you ask I to fake an injury not too late in the game just give I one at bat one moment Moody I want you to play I do but I could not live with myself all right then let I go you be break my hand right I be break your hand you do not see to it I get the bat I be go to break your head understand hey what be go on we be just funnin ' Jackie like a pair of old giggle pickaninny over here so Moody make a threat we both know player talk smack when it come to play time but when Clyde hit that home run all the negro run out on the field like they just win the World Series all except Moody what be the deal with the scar you follow up on that Negro player tell I he get it in a pop bottle fight with his cousin and and his cousin be not around no more exsuce I sir you Moody Brown Sittin ' here in front of this shop be not I who else be I go to be detective Jeffries and Valens Moody we wanna talk to you about Clyde Taylor why you wanna come here drudge up that old mess we may have a crack in the case from 60 year ago what crack you get one matter concern you it have to do with Clyde cut into your playing time oh that be a stale story and one you need to tell we about I play the negro league I make my 100 dollar a month beyond that sorry my memory 's break a witness hear you tell Clyde you would bust his head if you do not play and you do not play I will admit I be ready to square off with Clyde I be the squaring off type and a game against the major leaguer do not come around every day colored player get to feel what it be like to be equal if only for 3 hour on a Sunday afternoon but you do not get that Sir I want a career a real one Negro tell you that be not on his mind he be a liar Major league scout be out there I can tell they be just lickin ' their chop yeah they be waitin ' to spy I throw my double wind up what d'ya think'll look well on old Satchel there young rookie Yankie pinstripe or Dodger blue either or should look real sharp as long as it come with a rock chair Booker T Washington be tellin ' a joke now oh what about the color line do you really think someone 's go to break through Satchel any opinion on the subject oh let I see who be the good pitcher Joe DiMaggio say he would ever face you and I give a good interview too come on Moody calm down he be just sore because you be the future truth be tell Clyde'll beat we all to the major there a problem gentleman no sir Mr D Fine may I have a minute Clyde boy be heapin ' some high praise on you all this talk about the major I think it be good to pay they no mind that be good because I own your black ass do not you forget it so Dandridge see the writing on the wall end of the negro league and his million go down the drain but if he could hold on to Clyde maybe his team somehow survive what do Dandridge mean say he own Clyde I do not know but back in they day a millionare black man do not become one playin ' by the rule so the negro league make you a rich man Millionare by age 24 sure pick the right job I be not the only one 1945 it be one the large black dominate business in the United States and in ' 47 Branch Rickey sign Jackie Robinson so your league be on the way out and you be head for a bankruptcy Chubby young white fella who pay attention during black history month Clyde be your new marquee player it would be bad business not to tie he up I will not deny that question be how player sign month to month contract in those day no way you be just go to let he walk when the major come callin ' true so what do you have over Clyde what be this you own he stuff you ownin ' my ass be that a joke Clyde you get a gift that be go to make somebody a lot of money and since you be mine it be go to be I Major league 's open the game up to colored why would you think you could stop I because you be in love and I know with who think you be be careful huh why why would you wanna do this to I this whole season 's on the field you be so naive off simply put business so maybe I be not scared of what you know fine as long as you be not scared of a noose around your neck because you just know I love to talk suit up we will put this behind we I be go to break your neck I be the one who oughtta be sore that Lilly white skin bet it be even light where the sun do not shine what that must be like Lilly white skin Clyde 's lady friend be as fair as you so maybe after the game Clyde came look to break your neck and you break his head first if that be so I would 've kill he on the choo choo an hour after the game I be on a train to New York can you prove that I will let you do that so who be the white girl some dame on the arm of this wise guy Eddie Mason hear Eddie call her Legs so maybe Eddie know about Legs and Clyde get a hold of that bat and hit a home run of his own Leonard what be you do here I got lock out your mother tell I she be go on morning shift she do I think maybe that she be at Ronnie 's house who be Ronnie Dude that be be stay over Thought your sister be see some guy name Benjamin well that be the problem you never know Woman 's 45 act all 15 I run a check on Eddie Mason long sheet bad guy still alive Nope dead doer that never do it for I well you should think about that next time you go reach for a 60 year old case Eddie be charge with bank embezzlement a week after Clyde be kill so he be out and about on the night of the murder figure out who his lady be seem that Eddie have a thing for show girl then he be not such a bad guy after all Eddie prefer more legitimate dance he be a regular at Papa Belle 's review Home to old school Philly 's version of the Rockettes so maybe Legs be one of they Lil 's got Joe crumbly look through old publicity shot from Papa Belle 's Hey Leonard what Wanna show you something see that guy back there yeah he be old looking he know Clyde Taylor he do they be good friend wow I and Clyde be tight but I guess if he be draw to a white girl he would keep mum about it but you do remember a white girl hang around at practice a time or two but none of these gal ring a bell my box of doodad be good for nothing huh ah this be something one of my most prized possession not too hard to tell which one be I Nice Nice Miss do not know who I be stand along side that be you Clyde Jackie Robinson Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige Puny I and four giant of baseball so what be the deal with ball player and tobacco every one of you guy except Clyde have a big wad of gunk in your mouth Clyde like Bazooka Joe but most player do enjoy dip Clyde have a tobacco stain on his uniform Kinda odd if he do not chew let us dig out that uniform run the stain and then do a dna dragnet on all of our old timer Boss find three lady still in the area that work at Papa Belle 's their old publicity shot could one of these be her Jeepers Surprised I remember so well that be Legs her name 's Esther Davis live on the Main Line say hey young fella hey Ginger Rogers that be who I want to be I be 19 new in town Papa Belle 's be the place to be and that be where you meet Eddie Mason after the show he ask I to dine at his table and how have you meet Clyde Eddie and his crony want to swing by the ball field watch some practice while they be yackety yakking I go to find some shade and there he be by a drinking fountain this gorgeous man try to cool off we hardly say boo to one another but must have stand there a good 5 minute it be storybook it really be yeah but now you have two big problem yes one what to do about Eddie and two fall in love when it be still 1945 do Eddie know about you and Clyde even if he do he do not kill he Eddie be in Miami Beach that weekend scheme away so he be go you must 've be with Clyde that last day I go to the game and meet he afterwards at the water fountain like always feel like every other game when your name be Satchel Paige Clyde what be it what be wrong Dandridge know about we oh no say I have to play for he forever always or he be go to tell about we but if you do play for he he will keep his mouth shut but then I have to give up any chance of ever play in the major so so why be that so important because if a colored ball player can show he be as good as a white player in the most american game there be People with skin like mine will not be up at night pray he could scratch the color away so he can be normal Honey the world you be dream of be a long long way off from now get to start somewhere Clyde do not try to be a pioneer it be good to just keep your head down maybe the answer be for you to lift your head up hey man of the hour the world be wait for you oh Clyde Dad look there he be go out front baby so Troy and his father be still there during the press conference yes do they say anything else make any threat on Clyde no the father never speak just stand there so menacingly I think that be more frightening than have he say something if you be not such a looker I would be lose my patience right about now if you do not lie about your dad we would not be here I never lie what would you do with the Spaniard Detective Jeffries Troy hear some flattering thing about you the way I see it you 've be a good boy and a bad boy good because you tell I about Clyde teach civlity and how your bratty butt run off to tell daddy but bad because you leave out the part where you and daddy double back for Clyde ok we double back keep go when I tell he about the autograph deal that be the last straw he say he would not let that stand nice bat not real fair sneakin ' up on a man my son tell I what you do I be here to tell you I be embarasse he be a kid I be talk about I the name I use on you during the game oh your first at bat I could tell you be special Second at bat I could tell you be the good hitter I would ever face after that I throw you the hard ball I would ever throw you clean my clock do not feel good but now I know thank you daddy come on can we go yet Troy come here I want you to say you be sorry to Mr Taylor no get that tobacco out of your mouth but daddy you see the jig have his mitt on that white lady do not judge a book by its cover Ya understand so I say sorry have to that be real tobacco in your mouth use to do whatever my dad do that might explain the stain on Clyde 's jersey DNA will not help if the tobacco be Troy 's now can we call this meeting please yeah ok Troy at least your dad teach you a lesson not really I be still not real big on spook so do not judge a book by its cover do not even dent your knuckle head that part be about the girl so that get through just fine how be that about the girl well Dad recognize the lady she be from the same town down south where he grow up what be you get at Troy the white lady she be not really white she be black do your husband know Esther know what you be black no he do not but Clyde do yes he be the only one be that why he have to die what do you mean your secret be so important to you you have a whole lifetime as a white woman that tell just how important I come here from Macon Georgia I have two sister Dorothy and Ruby we be dirt poor how do you end up here we be live in Squalor Auntie say I have the light skin I could make a real living like a white person and then once here you be able to pass and get on at Papa Belle 's I have some dream of my own but maybe Clyde ask you to live color be go to out you you do ask he to keep his head down and Clyde think the answer be for you to lift your head up but you want your dream so you stop he from live his no but I could see the only way for we to both get what we want be to go out seperate way that be not what you say before you want Clyde to forget about the major but then someone change my mind Esther who be there it be I Crumbs be you cry I be just scared for Clyde he be butting head with Dandridge and he might get hurt yeah yeah I be scared too but because you know I think Clyde might hurt himself what do you mean he tell I about Dandridge and about how the major be no long even a dream Clyde say that yeah just now Cause he be choose you oh yeah you seem pretty happy about it yes I should go Esther wait ow sorry it be just I 've never see he so down I sure wish you would think about that think about it look just scram ok what just go take your good foot outta here go to some dance hall in New York or somewhere that be for you give Clyde his chance no it be complicated what be go on between we it be not something you would understand you think I be stupid no sweetheart I know a hell of a lot more about one thing than anybody you could round up I know that if you leave Clyde alone Dandridge will not have anything to hold over he he will be free to swap place with Babe Ruth and be the good player alive that be a fact but only if you leave then why do not Clyde tell I this oh come on he be a prince he would never tell you to your face please I be beg you leave we alone so Crumbs know all about the two of you Clyde make sure of that early on tell I I have to pass muster with the great club house manager in baseball or I be out Okey dokey next who be the first african American to play in the major league Jackie Robinson Wrong Fleet Walker he play back in 1884 DNA come in Joe we think you might be wonder you be sweat Crumbs tell another one about Clyde Sorry kiddo do not know if I have another I hear Clyde have a special bat he like to use I use to hold it for he you know he use it on the day he be kill the one he hit the home run with so tell we about that one Crumbs what d'you say huh one day Clyde hand I a bat and tell I to always have it on hand say he only use this bat when he really need it like when terrible pressure come creep up your neck what make that bat so special say because he hit more grounder with it than any other bat he ever use grounder but those be lame even so his last time up that be the bat he want to use this old pressure be creep up huh any man would 've be shake in his shoe and so you give he the bat and he tell I he be go to hit a grounder just for I so there he be look at the fast fast ball you ever do see and crack it be the home run of home run and that grounder he be talk about that be what I ask he say you will learn Crumbs Someday you will learn so if a homer and a grounder mean the same thing to you your nerve will not get to you so we would like to see that bat will not be need this no more wow Missing since the night Clyde die yeah we 've be look for that can I hold it I would well give it to your uncle come on Leonard let us take a look at this hey thank Joe for the nice time thank Crumbs when you get old Leonard do I one thing would ya do not remember what that bat do to Clyde Remembr what Clyde do with that bat Wanna sit there he be Crumbs

maybe this be why mom say you have trouble show your feeling because of lose grandma Great you two analyze I Otis do your dad ever show any violent tendency any temper problem my father would not have lose his head about some orderly no how do you know because by then my dad know he have to move on from my mom Otis ask I when you be come home I do not want to lie to he anymore then tell the

before your mom die right Bettie say it be she and the girl maybe Zelda know who be be punish and why we hear Bettie and her friend be by the hospital right around Christmas something involve art class that something involve you yeah it usually do you be talk about Bettie 's big idea what do you mean you see Bettie have this wacky idea that we need some culture for our brain and that Carmen would be the one supply it vis a vis art class so Carmen the rich one she be the art teacher but it be Bettie that get her heart set on make this a real class Real huh yeah and uh that be how Carmen got ruin I need to stop giggle this place echo like a church I be ready consider I an artiste okay we 've be talk about the human form last time we do line drawing of each other 's face Bettie do a very beautiful drawing of Annie Tonight we move on to the body depict the nude be an ancient tradition in art where artist seek to depict a more idealized human form I will say Betty you be a genius it be say Michelangelo believe that the figure of David already exist inside the block of stone he be carve and that his art would merely set David free Carmen I think we be ready to be set free I think I will faint Carmen oh bone just take a deep breath no this be absolutely forbid absolutely against the Holy Moses Mr De La Rosa say good bye Carmen this be your last chance no it be my idea it be Carmen 's last chance for what it be after that that the hospital and her family decide it be time for Carmen to have her lobotomy because of the art class the nude black man push they over the edge how have Carmen feel about get the the old ice pick through the eye what do you think it be the end of her world so this be how it be now what you work with someone you need eye contact it be your own business you be right thank I do not mean to make you upset all right as far as you be part of thing here you 've be real good everyone see you pull your weight I be try okay it be peace Peace I can not do this no I know I can not afford it I neither so do not look at I like that I will not stand aside do and do Hospital record say Carmen go in for the lobotomy but never check out I run her name down every which way no trace of she after that here be why the old lady I bring Otis in to see she be Carmen Hays confirm it from dental record so Carmen steal Bettie 's identity but here be what be screwy Carmen 's body no trace of a lobotomy so she get out of it somehow something interesting with Bettie 's remain though this bone be break when Bettie 's body be find in ' 54 Autopsy report say that be cause of death blunt force trauma but this break be clean Consistent with a surgical break Bettie 's the one who have the lobotomy so Bettie go under the knife Carmen walk free use Bettie 's name how be this get past nurse Olsen the one woman security check she would have know Carmen from Bettie she be in on it Nurse Olsen let I ask you you notice anything different about Bettie Petrowski when you sign she out of the hospital different like maybe she be not the same person she use to be like maybe she be Carmen look you know what we be talk about no one check in or out of that hospital without go through you that be true and Bettie Petrowski check out only it be really carman you help her escape with Bettie 's name why would I do that the Hays family be flush carman would have compensate you nicely I do not do anything for Carmen then how do you explain she get out and Bettie get her lobotomy you put your professional opinion aside and give Carmen what she pay you for you be wrong it be my decision as a medical professional to lobotomize Bettie you have to understand at the time we think it be the cure absolutely not Bettie wait hear I out I tell she you would never do it Bettie just stop no I will not Dr Freeman be the foremost lobotomist in the country he be only in Philadelphia twice a year I be say Carmen do not want it but I do let he take I I be the one who need to be cure there be nothing wrong with Carmen you be not a doctor Bettie Carmen 's only problem be she be trap here by her family and can not show the world her art would not you like that Carmen I do not need to be famous but you need to be free and the world need you how many people can make picture like your I do not feel right about this Bettie this be harebraine be not it no I 've read it Lobotomy 's mean to even out your mood that be what I need so I can see my otis again please Nurse you say Dr Freeman 's the good he be this be my last chance if I wait Otis'll be move on with another mother a lady from church and I will have to let he go all I want to do be paint all I want be Otis I be sure something in your plan do not go right because Bettie never see Otis again the snowstorm ruin our plan how road be close so instead of Bettie go to the private hospital that Carmen have pay for she be bring back to city asylum after the lobotomy that be when Dr Paquette got involve the head of the hospital what do he do to protect the hospital and his reputation he he make Anton clean up my mess Anton do Dr Paquette tell you to kill Bettie Petrowski I do not remember that you be her friend Anton you care about her do not tell I this do not eat at you he say to get rid of her say nobody would miss she anyhow Otis miss she I think I could save myself and my little sister but I make a bargain with the devil that day what happen he tell I he would use the art class against I turn it into a sexual allegation if I go to jail there would be nobody to take care of my sister where have you take she she be like a child could not fend for herself I put she in my truck she could not understand where we be go I do not know if Otis still remember this but I always think it should go back to he some way what would you do with her Anton I try to be merciful it be all right Bettie be not it beautiful outside it be not so bad not so bad the park that be the

lose 200 000 dollar a day how about drug not in her system but standard autopsy do not test for poison our diarist 's method of choice all right start with Scott Amy 's partner he can tell you who be on the computer other angle be the poison Meaning exhume the body test again need family 's permission um there be a sister a Laura Local Good you have my permission to do whatever you need to do well it be likely with a new autopsy we will get new information you really think someone poison she someone sure write about it be there anyone at her office she have a problem with I would not know she be live here but after she and Scott get the venture capital money I almost never see her Business take up all of her time she work late every night went row every morning if I see she she be asleep right there couch surfing she call it what about this Scott be they involve at all I do not think Amy would have say no but Scott like they busty and adore that be not Amy so strictly business she say they make the perfect team Scott have the flash get the attention Amy know how to close a deal ever see the two of they in action I be here when they first got fund their whole world change in a day well interesting idea but how be you go to make it work exactly two Wharton graduate Suma Kum Ladi we will find a way good packaging I admit but it be not really an answer it be 3 am your child 's have a seizure you be speak gibberish you need help uh huh you go online what be happen with this boy and there we be Lionstaff Type in the symptom get answer in a matter of second and instruction how to help he it be a lofty goal help people and a sound business idea the user will be desperate desperate people pay well I get to tell you when I be your age the only thing I have go on in my garage be band Whatd'ya think I be in how much how be a million sound after that they rent the office and she be pretty much go but she keep live here yes eat raman I tell she ' Honey you be a millionare if I be you I would be set up house on the Main Line ' sound like a tough lady desperate people and all no you should understand the reason Amy want this company we have a brother Gage he die just before he turn 10 the picture on the table when she talk about be online in 3 in the morning she be talk about herself you say Amy do not have a heart attack she do but someone might have help she along I guess anything be possible those day be crazy how so you be 24 too young to rent a car you can not imagine be a multimillionare can not imagine your friend would die yeah but you be and they do and you lose it all it be a wild ride and I be lucky could not have take it without her Meaning Amy have the idea I do the dog and pony show she do the headwork anyone around who feel different you mean do she have enemy yeah we call they employee Malvender have something he would like to discuss ok he come to I I tell he he have to talk to both of we go on Mal I want to be make partner Partner I be build your system without I you have no business well your work have be really creative it sure have thank you but Scott and I start the business it be ours so I do not matter you do that be why you pull a big salary sorry guess it be no can do well can we revisit this later there be only two partner of Lionstaff Scott and I I get the picture Ghasty idiot woman I admit I lean on she for the bad cop I do not enjoy say no that word Malvender use Ghasty Hindi for whore we learn a few variation Malvender sound like an angry guy and he sound like her diarist Poison stop here ghasty heart Recognize that key word there ghasty what be this it come off a computer from Lionstaff 1999 so because it be a Hindi word I must have write it do you no so how come it sound like you everyone in that office pick up my swear word yeah but you have a real beef with Amy you want to be make partner she say no hard on you have a woman turn you down that whole time be hard for I New country no friend try to send money home my behaviour be not too graceful but not this so you do not carry a grudge not for she shut you down I be lucky not to get catch between she and Scott I think they be friend start that way when the big money come war be it true you buy a Ferrari why not in crab oil Scott they way you be spend we can not afford any set back I do not plan on any and I have a great new idea form what be that Superbowl ad a million five for 30 second a million five be more than we start with and we 've grow I have a good feeling about this we be not do it Scott too late it be do beginning of the firework so he make a million dollar decision without she and it be a flop no ticker from the ad we get lot of hit but zero business suddenly we be 3 million in the hole no wonder she be mythe that be when the business start to slide throw down between Scott and Amy they escalate into silence like a shout Scott say he and Amy be friend opposite be true a ccording to this Malvender dude let I guess they fall out over money not that Scott tell we that sound like a reinterview News from the ME Amy 's body have 8 time the normal level of potassium chloride that a poison not normally but a high enough dose induce heart attack how be it ingest Dissolves in water kick in within half an hour so she probably drink it that morning that point to someone close new question for the sister New autopsy show your sister be poison Laura with potassium chloride but you know what that be I bet be a chemistry teacher and all yes know who would 've be with her 6 30 that morning no idea well how about you so we disagree on how to spend money see you say that like it be no big deal in my line of work when people fight about money it usually do not end too well I be not some street corner thug so you get some more refined way of gettin ' what you want hand off Poison maybe why would I want my sister dead hard live next to all that success none of it be yours I be proud of her Pride can turn to envy on a dime after Gage die Amy be all I have sister have to stick together if not you Laura then who it be 6 30 am I do not know she row with anyone no the river be her place she go there alone no boyfriend anyone who stay over Amy be drive focus be not attract to a lot of guy she get a kitten when she move in always joke it would be her her career and her beloved cat my true feeling Amy die of a broken heart she never get over Gage convenient theory for you we be partner I would not profit from hurt she no and ultimately we have the same wolf at our door that wolf be Coleman after the Superbowl fiasco he rain fire on both our head I think you be go to sell that I be not givin ' up the car make an impression how be you keep up payment another loan Mom Lay off Scott Amy I buy that excuse I you 've just be throw around my money like confetti have not you be this about the ad Cliff you think this be a game Monopoly of course not I give you a million dollar that I 've earn sweating and bleed and you spend it on car watch sushi Appearences matter then you get around to an actual business decision and you blow your wad on one ad we think the exposure be worth the gamble no no who be stupid idea be this it be a joint decision it be a fiasco we be sorry let another one get by you I will do bad than this he have a right to be mad but he be psycho mad sound like you duck for cover and let he lay on Amy not exactly I at my good News we get some background on Cliff Coleman I too he be get a rage problem he also have a rich wife in ' 94 she die of a heart attack like Amy

time I could always feel it something be eatin ' he up Carl Burton 's military service record I do not see anything in there that could make the guy call himself a coward award bronze star purple heart oh this be it he take early release what be that it mean he leave the prison camp early Thought you could not leave well not under honorable circumstance the code of conduct among POWs be that the sick and long serving go first but Carl be not either of those then how do he get to the front of the line tell the VC guard what they want to hear let them use them for propaganda that do not sound like a gung ho fighter pilot why would he do that why he be sick of gettin ' beat nearly to death five year in a row miss family he be stow in solitary it be hard to know what a code like that start to mean at that point but a lot of guy do hang in yeah hundred of them and they would not have be fan of Carl 's and they come home a week before Carl be kill end of March ' 73 main group of pow get back any of them come back to Philly a guy name Raitt from Antioch Roger Raitt a Navy Commander you know he I serve with he be a long time I be not much for the reunion Truth be tell I be not

carry a gun every day that be what I could not revisit Roger I wanna talk to you about a guy you be in prison with Carl Burton Wound up dead shot right after you guy get back I remember Comin ' home it have to be hard to adust it make I realize any day I wake up with a doorknob on the inside of the door it be a good day maybe someone else do not see it that way come back angry want to settle a score everyone have a breaking point Carl reach his over there I do not respect it but I understand Hard to imagine all the POWs do we be like brother John one of they go after Carl I would 've know I be talkin ' about a lot of soldier and a guy they think be a traitor we would only be home a week and all of we already know Carl 's bad punishment be live with what he do Rex 's 51st bombing run he gets hit Ejects come down outside Hanoi spend a few hour hide in a cave try to get up enough strength to move but when he hear a north vietnamese patrol he take off on a broken leg with only his pistol to hold off 20 guy chase he for hour Rex drag himself along just ahead of they till he come to this hollow out tree and squeeze in how dare you I be here to pay my respect how dare you sneak in here Mom stop it you do not know what this man do to your father Daniel let us calm down we be here for Rex Rex would not want you here you betray he Betrayed everyone you be a disgrace daddy ok Ned I be sorry Ruth Carl I think it be well if you do not go to the reception yeah I will tell the guy that tell they I die over there Roger tell they I be already a ghost guy who stick it out resist the most do well when we get home the one who give in have a tough time yeah how bad do you think it be for Carl Bad enough I think he would kill himself the gun be find 5 foot away from his body you remember how long it take a man to die from a gut shot might 've crawl away after but who commit suicide by shoot themselves in the stomach Guy aim for his heart whose arm do not work anymore could be my last cheesesteak for a while oh yeah Julie 's talkin ' about tofu Lieutenant Miller how be you do just drop a guy in lock up how be the Burton case pannin ' out Nick Veera this be Kat Miller she be the one that turn up the pow bracelet good work thank so well the late be Carl might have commit suicide a close fire would have leave lead residue on his clothe right Labs checkin ' so I hear you be doing well over in narcotic oh good I like it so be that your long term area of interest I never think I would be a cop in the first place so I be game for whatever crop up I think bein ' in blue be every girl ' dream you get something else on mind it be a long story but here I be my option be open that be good to know Ken Westin cop to takin ' your dad 's bracelet Ken do really dumb reaction to your mom drop he do that maybe make the drug scenario less likely maybe Ned there be an incident at Rex Potter 's memorial the day your father die yeah I remember it the rest of the pow take issue with your dad show up we could see it in their face when we walk in they hate he must 've be pretty crush for he yeah one of those pow think maybe he could not take it any long you mean kill himself however he die Ned it be not go to change what he be to you I know a reason why he might have kill himself I what I do hey buddy I know it be not fun to be around people yell like that it be ok I love you I too daddy so you do not mind if I eat all your ice cream you could have your own so what can I get you guy Bomb pop please hey I remember you you come in last summer with your dad I be his dad Carl Burton hi no it be another man a soldier he have be over in a Vietnam prison camp have some break your heart story about it I be not here last summer I be that be not I I be sure it be this little boy who be that who be it Ned Ken Ken be not a pow do he use my name tell this lady he be your dad yes and you let he why Ned I do not know so Ken 's not just move in on Carl 's wife while he be go he be pretend to be he I be with he a few time when he do it do not stop he you be 7 but I know it be wrong so after your dad find out march I home go down to the basement for a while then leave where be your mom Asleep have be ever since lab result be back no trace of lead on Carl 's clothe that rule out suicide so even if that be what Carl be think that night someone get to he first if it be I I be head ' after the guy posin ' as my kid 's dad say here Carl be at Rex Potter 's funeral reception even after Roger Raitt tell he not to show Ken live near the Potters know they so maybe he be at the reception that be where Carl go lookin ' for he after Carl get something out of the basement maybe a weapon he go to confront Ken and never make it back Westin spend four month in Texas in ' 71 wait to be ship out have a nervous breakdown discharge before he leave US soil all right you want we in there I get it sorry to pull you from work Ken I need to talk to you oh sure so it sound like Carl Burton be comin ' apart at the seam when he get back yeah he seem to have trouble adjust it be tough to watch that guy over there snappin ' out get to go home get out of here you can see they be never go to be the same you know what I mean oh I do everybody go crap so and so lose it but in the back of your mind you be think I be with he in your weak moment you lay schemin ' at night come close to doing some crazy stuff yeah so Carl turn up at this funeral reception where he be disinvite what be it like antagonistic he be look for trouble so you see he the night he die that be funny 'cause you do not tell we that you say you be at the bar tossin ' back a few when Carl be shoot Yep go there after ok then so that be a lie you tell we not intentionally it be be a long time Memory 's middle aged now that be ok it be a small time lie for you do that bother you Ken 'cause it do not seem violent to I I be use to it maybe because gun have be a part of I since I be a kid I be 17 year old when I go over there I think it be a toy until I watch a few man die slowly but you know what I be talk about what this do not because you be a soldier because we know you be not Ah Lieutenant how long do Carl bleed this be serious how long do Carl bleed I could never in extreme circumstance you learn about human nature but what kind of person would pretend to be a pow I would like a lawyer why what do you do I do not do anything to Carl well you take what belong to he and walk around like it be yours do you really think someone who have a nervous breakdown at Fort Hood would survive five year in the Hanoi Hilton it be a bad lie you tell I know I know I think I may have a disease you tell people you be a racecar driver a brain surgeon not a pow now talk about that night Carl confront you at that reception yes and what do you do nothing Got call out I do not have much time after I parachute down I have to start my escape on a busted leg I hear you wanna be I excuse I well might as well take these use my name my wife my kid so now you get everything that mean a damn thing to I Carl this be akward you have something wrong with you you know that well that be the pot callin ' the kettle black you be a fraud Daniel I be sorry hey Carl let us play a game this be a grenade and you be you Daniel get away from I and that be how you get the bracelet a few minute later Daniel leave the house go after Carl I tell your detective the kid be a problem yeah well you be a real solid judge of character Ken we find out the truth that day huh Daniel what truth about Carl be not the guy you think he be underneath hearing about early release do not change that so why the big scene at the reception you be real key up give Carl what for call he a fraud look Vietnam be complicated the pow be getting torture and all they hear from America be that this war 's a mistake I get it I get Carl throw in the towel see that be interesting but that be what an adult think then what do a 15 year old who just lose his dad think that Carl abandon Rex Potter to die and he run home with his tail between his leg while your dad be still takin ' it bust limb broken tooth do not talk about my dad you do not know what it be like for he but Carl do and he still leave he there I get one letter from my dad but the government black it out halfway he take the time to write I and they black it

he could be in danger from but I do know that it never make sense to I that trevor would kill himself he never say anything like that well he do not say too much to we anyway around then he be in a phase yeah Moody lock himself up in his room but to go that far he would 've really have to've be hurtin ' and we would 've see that what be it like for trevor at school any enemy I do not think so he do not really have any friend he do not fit the popular mold he be the creative type that be why very sensitive very how do you mean you know this Kurt Cobain from the band Nirvana kill himself yeah

after he die our phone bill come back and there be page after page of he call some teen hotline Crisis hotline kind of thing that be the one thing that make we think maybe he be really havin' dark thought but it be too late by then obviously the teen hotline Trevor call be not just for suicidal kid it be for any kind of crisis so he could 've talk about what he be in danger from possible but they can not give out transcript protect caller privacy I get the call log from the month before trevor 's death look at this one of the volunteer be name Dawn H like Dawn Hill be this the same girl who be in detention with trevor the day he die I bet they be one the same I wonder if that be a coincedence Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania yes that be I I talk to Trevor Dawson on the teen hotline once you be train to talk to kid who be suicidal kid in any kind of crisis pretty coincedental ou and trevor wind up in detention together the one time I ever get detention be the day trevor die yeah so you two know each other not really teen hotline be anonymous first name basis only very strict rule about that but you know he be the same trevor that day in detention I figure it out but

empty maybe they wait until the heat die down I will check sale record at the time of the murder Emma be live in Fishtown that be not deb recruit territory I do not know some kind of Philly Cinderella Handsome be not he even in that marshmallow your husband Timothy this be the album from Emma 's debutante season pretty important to Emma debuting to tell you the truth I be the one who really want it yeah I grow up fascinated by debs they seem so perfect like the whole world be theirs you know my sketchy understanding of this world it be wealthy girl right from the main line Chestnut hill but your family be from Fishtown yes so how do you go from there to have my own daughter debut uh yeah we have a different cache Timothy in ' 68 astronaut be big than the beatle and my husband be on the list to go the moon all of a sudden we be society be there a date yet for the landing not yet but think your husband be go to walk on the moon I think it will be next August they be stick by Kennedy 's timetable my you be well informed Emma know more than I do she love fly you could be stewardess or a pilot you must be so glad to have this club Irene Someplace your child can go and and not be run wild on the street with hippie yes there be something I 've be mean to ask you our debutante season start soon how would you like Emma to make her debut but Irene we be just the wife and daughter of an astronaut it would be an honor for we what would I have to do you go to party all season and you bow to your father in a gorgeous white dress when you be present at the ball it be very prestigious and you will meet everyone and you can take Travis as your escort be not he your boyfriend but I have to take chip it be a business thing between our dad this way Travis can come too oh this be so lucky I would think the girl have all be choose by now I have some pull in that area after all I be the mistress of the robe Mistress of the what the title be from century ago it mean she be in charge well it do not sound like this ball be Emma 's type of thing she only agree after I point out the opportunity it could mean the people she would meet she want to go to college so you be glad when she say yes take Travis as her escort it be the mistake of my life Emma have trouble with Travis if she do I be blind to it I think those people could do no wrong I want to help she instead I hand she over to a murderer so that be the one huh the one paint you like it be my job figure out what people like what they be attract to I learn a lot in this room hope the same go for we Detective Rush and Jeffries homicide be this about Sadie oh I 've already get a javert watch my every move that be for your wife 's murder this be about Emma Vine Emma she die 38 year ago it come up again since she die exactly the way your wife do Respectfully no she do not fall down a flight of stair that much be true but it be my belief that Sadie have a seizure and fall she be epileptic it be the only thing that make any sense what about Emma she have a medical condition too I hardly know Emma I escort she to the ball as a favor to my girlfriend Landon that be right I have no motive and no clue why she die well these girl take the debutante season very seriously right there be a bit of talk about the fact that Emma get someone else 's spot who be this someone else Sloane kinny big boozer all around floozy do Sloane have it out for Emma like Emma have yank the golden ticket right out of her hand ¢Ü Melanie 's beautiful people ¢Ü I hope you like it it be Tricia Nixon 's recipe so sloane Emma 's dad be an astronaut that be the most pretty neat thank he be go to be the first man on the moon and Emma want to be the first girl to go to Harvard they do not let girl into Harvard sure they do right after they get off the bus from Wellesley it be just that Harvard have the good physics program you mean like p E you know if you be interested there be an echo thing in the ballroom really I will show you when we be there you be go to the ball yes the rose come this morning I do not get mine I be not debut Sorry sloane do I get bump for her we do not even know her Sloane be new money which make she a bad person no what I mean be she be expendable so Irene cut she out for Emma so Sloane have an axe to grind with Emma but Emma die at the ball yeah but Sloane be there and she be angry why would she be there she be not a debutante true but I know I see she any proof of that ask Chip if you can find he your good friend but why would we believe he you probably would not just like you do not believe I you be right Travis I do not well join the club that be why I have to hire all these fancy lawyer to help the guy that nobody believe Travis point to sloane a girl that got knock out of be a deb because Emma take her place Got Sloane 's mug shoot from a DUI in ' 69 compare it to the benevolent society 's photo from the ball this Travis talk a good game huh well smooth but I still say lightning do not strike twice Miller have any luck track the swan ring she put the word out to every pawn shop and auction house in Philly remember a sale from 38 year ago that be one long shot here take a look be not that sloane stare dagger at Emma feel like I should 've polish my shoe for this neighborhood no kid nice crib out here you be come to the Sixers game right jeffrie get ticket who be go you I and he well I invite Miller but she be get her other thing something to do with Veronica this morning I hear she order flower for Wednesday night sound special why do not she just tell we because it be none of our business we be coworker we should share our life with each other yeah good luck with that this be it I want to be a debutante more than anything in the world so it must 've hurt something awful when Emma take your place oh it do I think I would actually die I could hardly get out of bed well you get up to go to that ball why sloane for chip but Chip be Landon 's escort but they be just friend Chip want I around for after if you get my drift I get it I be always good for that so you hang around the ball till he do his escort duty I watch a little but I be mostly upstairs in our hotel room so Emma just get a free pass even though she be in the big white dress and you be not I would lose by that point I would already do the bad I could and what be that find something out and run with it it may be your night girl but please try to let the boy lead oh darn it I step on you again I do not notice but for you it be back on one okay can I ask you something sure why be you debut my mother say it be an opportunity what do you say it be all right actually today 's be pretty fun why I 've be watch you at all the party you do not seem as excited as the other girl it be not really my thing like physics well this be physics everything be physics my foot describe a vector with force go in a direction trace a closed system I have not really think of it that way maybe you two should find some empty space in another building I be sorry I be hopeless I be afraid do not do not look at they Dance with I Dance with I you think Travis be fall for Emma and vice versa Landon would not like that when I tell she she be extremely upset you tell she well I guess I think I could get my place back it do not work so how tick off be Landon ever see a child throw a tantrum take something that be theirs when they be not use to hear no yeah Travis be Landon 's until Emma show up and Landon have go 18 year without ever hear no so what do they call you Coach my formal title be mistress of the robe but the one at the end she call I mom she look like you well hopefully no one steal her boyfriend like Emma steal yours excuse I Emma Vine Travis Whitman 1968 Sloane say they be get close and that you do not like it that be a long time ago so be the murder we be work Sloane tell I what she have see at dance practice between those two and you get angry a lady do not get angry although sometimes what she do instead be bad okay we will see you all tomorrow at the hotel no later than 6 o'clock could not your father make it dear this be the last rehearsal he have to fly down to cape Canaveral he be come back tonight you know how much we be all look forward to see you bow to he Emma do you need a ride home I be go to catch the bus in that I have street clothe and a book what be you read Feynman 's lecture on physics Impressive how about I get the car and I will meet you two girl out front Travis have that book be it his we be talk about it so your bow be really graceful Landon I 've be practice it my whole life nervous about tomorrow a little but I hear there be this acoustic anomaly in the ballroom that Travis say he be go to show you there be something about Travis you do not know he be jewish he be he hide it well his whole family do but that be the dirty little Whitman secret but I think Jews be not allow I guess it be like spit on your food before someone else could take it that be your way of try to keep Travis I love he even though I could see that he like Emma so what would 've happen if Travis 's secret get around would 've be the end of he at the club he his whole family Socially People have a lot of um business connection through there too and they would 've lose they because they be jewish I be tell you how it be not how I think it should be excuse I so Travis have get a secret and Emma know it sound like the escort have motive after all really push that sale huh Travis guess you get hungry lawyer to feed huh why be you back here you say you barely know Emma when really you be fall for her it be no reason to kill she no there be a another reason well you seem to know more than I do your family secret the one you tell Landon our secret well your name Weissman in 1955 your family change it to Whitman because back then there be only so high a jewish family could climb our name be change it be true and Emma find out threaten to expose you no now I do not need any picture to read you Travis you be practical you need cash you sell some painting you need to guard a secret it be not like that there be no threat it be more like we both just come clean I ring the bell but I just come out to I be try to see Saturn 's ring you leave this at the club I take it off to try on those glove this ring it be it be special to I I find it before you leave try to flag you down but I think you be avoid I Landon tell I something about you your family that we be jewish be that a problem no but I wonder why you hang around with people who do not like who you really be why do you right because I be keep a secret too my dad got pull from the moon shoot yesterday my mom will not let I tell anyone she want we to keep up appearance like my family Appearances be the only thing that matter to these people you already know that I guess I 've be try not to notice for your mother More because I do not want to stop be around you do Landon know this be go on no we be go to deal with it after the ball then Emma die so why not tell I this before you do not want to hear it you just want I to hold out my hand for the cuff like everybody else in this city come on Travis you expect people to believe two woman in your life end up dead at the bottom of the stair and that be just chance it sound unbelievable but it be what happen right I have a piece of news today second autopsy show Sadie do have a seizure moment before she fall like I think be that accord to a doctor you be pay to testify no it be accord to your medical examiner so maybe this Travis be not such a monster maybe terrible coincidence can happen I will be in touch my lawyer say the charge may be drop but it must be a mistake I be sorry the M E 's report be pretty clear about his wife 's seizure but I know he kill Emma I know it I spend 38 year not know and then I open that paper I can not walk away now you have child a daughter you know right you know in your heart when something happen to they do not you yeah please do not drop her case Lillian if we do continue you have to be honest with we have not I be you do not tell we about your husband that he could not go to the ball no the day before the ball he be in the hospital yes so what be your plan I know you want Emma to debut more than anything what could we do on the day of the ball we go to Irene to tell she I frankly think we would be kick out but you be not no because instead we find Matthew and he be our angel hello lady be you excited about tonight I be afraid that be why we be here we will not be come what Timothy 's not well he be in the hospital Lillian he be all right but he be not go to the moon honestly I do not know what be go to happen to he Mom he be strong I be sure Emma 's right anyhow I hate to embarrass Irene but without her father Emma will not be able to debut Emma could make she bow to I oh no we could not why not I would be proud to present the first woman astronaut but dad be not we walk together I could walk with you both no if her father can not come she should not either Landon do not be like that Dad this be for you and I she be not your daughter I be Landon I would never want I wish you have never show up because you be ruin everything sound like Landon bare her claw she be just upset I wonder how upset Lillian do Matthew have a special reason for help you we would know each other grow up my mother and I use to clean his family 's house that be why it mean so much to you that Emma be a debutante that you would grow up your whole life with your face press against the glass I do not envy the material thing I envy how safe they be how protect you want that for your daughter maybe I think it be possible because I grow up with Matthew he make you feel like you belong around everyone else we be what we be by ourselves we be friend I can not wait until I be read the sport page again instead of society news hear

more night Bye Ray Philly PD show I your hand what Phil Jorgensen yeah you be under arrest for the murder of Roween Ryan and a couple of bank robbery Phil I do not kill Roween yes you do you hate she why would I hate she because she be Yoko Ono try to break up the band she be throw Julius off his game okay that part be true I do think that so when Julius came beg off the job you shut he down what no Julius do not want to stop the robbery he be tell story story to whom Roween he know she be go to go south on he so he beat she to the punch so it be all just a con Sure that be what he do the thing be go forward as plan we already get everything from she we need still you be not concerned now Ro be not expect it she could be a problem Julius say she would be too scared to be a problem and if so shoot her Cut and dry hat 's why I have to warn she he be lie to you Ro about the robbery about the two of you you be not say this the other night at the apartment just glare at I you have not even say boo till now there be lot of reason why people do not talk do not mean they do not want to it be a setup Ro besides he be get someone else someone else be honest you really think you be his style and I do not mean that in a bad way I mean it in a good way oh you think it be just impossible that I could turn someone 's head huh no no you be something Ro yeah right maybe it be you that be hand out the line that be not a line Ro Julius have a way on people all right he spot your weakness mine be booze you tell I he be get you under his thumb I have not make a decision for myself till now I be not put move on you Ro but after tomorrow I be go to be my own man I know I be good for someone tomorrow the bank there be nothing we can do about that you have to go along or he be go to hurt you I swear who be she who you say he have someone else you do not need to know that Phil if you be really be sincere you will tell I and do you tell she yeah Spill Darla Dunaway Bank teller work alongside Ro and current branch manager so work her way up Darla be Julius 's real squeeze huh and our other inside connection on the bank job Darla you be the one make it with Julius not Roween and it be my idea to get Ro involve because she be the head teller so the tale you tell about Julius stop in for a Cashier 's check be really you two reel Ro in that day be like a game great fun so they rob the bank shoot Ro and split but you stay so you can do it all over again three day ago no I be not a part of it this time and why should we believe that because Julius dump I too when after the first heist I tell he I be not some Roween he tell I that be exactly what I be and Julius know you will not rat he out now because you be an accomplice but I could not swallow it any long not after what he do to we Us this be for Roween too under the impression you hate Ro probably what she think too that last morning before she die what be your problem I know know what about you how you be part of the robbery how you be with Julius Ro think of it this way it be I and Julius 's car you and Phil be in the backseat be grateful you be not getting kick to the curb I guess it be true then do not let that mirror fool you excuse I Julius see we the same way he be play you too if you could just see that together we could stop this stop the robbery on your own there Ro do not sell I short what be you go to do call the cop it be risky but there be still time do it I know it face it Ro you be a toad I be not it be not my fault you try so hard to be a bitch and one day you will see you do not need to even now you still believe the knight on the white horse be come to take you away 8 20 well get your little heinie out there it be almost time turn out Ro be right Julius screw I we 've get Rick and Phil in custody now we need Julius been track he we think he be in upper Darby somewhere any idea Luke 's lodge his favorite b and B and where he turn I into a bank robber Good now tell we Julius shoot Ro and he will take the bad of it all I know be Julius go to the vault and Rick be cover the door leave Phil at the teller window where Ro be shoot well thing just go from bad to bad for you Phil what do you mean you be all go down for the robbery but you be take the heat for Ro 's murder I tell you Julius be the one but the brother join force against you and Darla support their theory so three against one you know Funny I have no reason to go this time before I be desperate my boozing put I in the red this time around my house be in order still Julius talk you into it he find out Darla 's branch manager now Job would be a piece of cake we would score big this time hype it pretty good huh he could 've be the world 's great car salesman but it do not matter I just think why not I be empty anyway Empty why because the one you love do not love you back no in the end I think she would 've thing be when someone open a door you get to be ready to go through so Ro be hold

who be you root for oh I be Switzerland neutral I know if I be choose between my boyfriend and a girl I despise I be go with the guy maybe that be where the towel come in Andi 's towel be lace with sodium nitrate and I be Marie Curie cross our mind I have a lot of thing to work through back then aforementione emotional issue but I be in a study group the night she be kill for one thing with three other people we will need those name and more importantly Andi 's win actually mean something to I Women 's lib you know oh boy be Andi a big activist no and that be a problem you look great you know you do not have to do that MYOB okay I do not really have an opinion about title IX I just want to play tennis what tell I you be misquote um no Title IX protect woman athlete I just think of myself as an athlete hey leave your little backyard kid there be a revolution go on ever wonder why we have to use the chem building bathroom to change for practice I guess I never think about it the guy have a locker room accord to Fritz it be beautiful Title IX get we a locker room a van decent budget same as the guy I care about tennis not politic hey bambi wake up this be our moment you be our golden girl and I be not go to let you blow it sound like the coach be a dragon lady breathing fire all over Andi Lot of sore point between they biggest one be Andi 's dad want Susan fire not that it happen because Andi die first I guess that be true you think Susan could 've harm her she be radical believe in make change by any mean necessary I be not do that interview you remember the battle of the sex match in ' 73 Court one Andi Simmons bring Fritz Adams to his knee that be a great day I enjoy it good for the cause knock the bastard down a peg Fair to say you take a pretty extreme view on politic have to no one give you an inch without a fight and now you 've climb all the way up to athletic director say what you mean if Andi be get in the way of your agenda she be good for my agenda she just need enlightenment we also hear her dad want you fire 'cause he do not want to stop coach she but after Andi die you keep your job I hear you so Bill be a tennis dad overreach pain in the ass we tussle over Andi both want your piece of she 'cause she be so special but we come together when we run into a real enemy run around run around Nice and put it away we just have a three hour practice Bill do not start she be my player who put a racket in her hand when she be four year old be that you Susan or be that I so this be the superstar they be all talk about Arnold Brown athletic director oh hey hello good to meet you Bill and Andi Simmons they say you be the next Billie Jean King I would like to be and I hear there be a battle of the sex match schedule Fritz Adams and I be play number one against number one sound like something you dream up Susan just try to raise money since we 've get such a crap budget let I guess the troll at the woman 's center put you up to this no I want to play I want to win well that certainly would be interesting uh but problematic too why these be complicated time Andi a lot of demand be make I be just go out there to play it be not complicated for I still this title IX business be a slippery slope we do not want to embarrass the university and we have an obligation to man 's athletic Embarrass this kid be dynamite she be go to make you proud it be harmless enough to have an exhibition game but an upset could stir the pot it will be bad for everyone you mean I should throw the match due respect I doubt Fritz need the help you have not see what this girl can do and I always play to win maybe I be not clear an upset be not a possibility and I will be watch to he that be the last word he be so sure Andi would just obey he and lose on purpose in his mind that be what they have agree to but then Andi win and be dead the next day the Penn athletic director Arnold Brown die four year ago dead suspect Love that he be all over these article on title IX big opponent the same guy who write those story cover Andi and woman 's tennis Eric Witt I know that name he write a sport column for the Philly post well maybe he can tell you how the a d take it when Andi disobey he head over there you do okay Nicky go home tonight by invitation Ambush she will give I she come to Jesus I will beg forgiveness we will settle back in familiar drill huh one that be get less and less interesting may be time to change it up a D Brown go ballistic when Andi win that match yeah because now she be the poster child for title IX and he want thing to stay just like they be Women athlete back of the bus so maybe he retaliate after Andi win actually I can vouch for his whereabouts that night yeah he be at the paper with I do what breathe down my neck do not want I to glorify she in the story but you kind of do anyway you should have see my first draft you get any heat from the other player for all the press you give Andi Grace Andersen do not like it well Grace have an alibi kind of relieved to hear that why be that there there be an incident at a reception go on it be the night before the match at an athletic alumnus event

for Dennis get the good review of my life Congratulations Rafe we hear you get yourself a gun a few week before Dennis die well how be that relevant Dennis be shoot in a stick up new information say otherwise well I uh I be afraid I do get a gun and why would you do that I hear the cop movie blue blood be shoot in Philly I be go to audition I be method I need to tap into the emotion of hold a gun if I be go to play a cop so you buy a real one yeah I go to target practice too and then the studio decide to cast blue blood out of Hollywood where be the gun now Rafe it be steal out of my office just a little time before the show and you never mention this before you see I buy it illegally so I could not exactly report it steal that be kind of shaky Rafe especially since people see you and Dennis fight say you be not too happy with he our relationship be tumultuous yes you see my style be to tear actor down and then build they back up I do not shoot they we could bring he in right now for buy the gun might help he tap into the emotion of jail time look I do not kill Dennis and I do not know who do but there be a little situation that Dennis have get himself into ¢Ü I meet this truly remarkable girl ¢Ü ¢Ü in this really incredible town ¢Ü ¢Ü and she skillfully manage to talk her way into my room ¢Ü very nice you two what be you smile about I do not know I 've just be kind of fly on air since rehearsal start I too this place be kind of magical be not it all right now do you all remember when I say that trust be the key to performance well I want to try something put down your script come up here and form a circle here be what I want I want you to fall back into the arm of the person behind you before you fall I want you to tell a secret about yourself something that you have never share before it be all about create a safe environment people start with you Robin I feel relief when my father die Clinton to I I do not trust any of you I respect that Dennis I start drive a cab because I do not want to be lonely all the time that be deep that be deep Nora to Dennis I think I be fall in love with my lead man I Plenty of blowup at this place huh welcome to the theater so what be Lyle 's problem he have a thing for Nora I be afraid how do Dennis take Nora 's confession he make it perfectly clear to Nora that he have a fiancee but she do not like that do either of they have access to your office where you keep the gun everyone do I never lock it Nora and Lyle be on their way in now so we be look at the love triangle Yep Nora angry at the rejection Lyle the jealous outsider we believe this director Plenty of big drama with these people hard to sort through what be real and what be make up that Clinton kid seem on the level you kid you actually buy his act I will put money down on Clinton be clean five buck five buck what kind of stake be those 20 buck on the director as doer big liar big ego I be go with Lyle the piano man Sneaky guy with a bad crush I say Nora Lady could handle a 38 easy and the female specie be not exactly on my good side right now what be this it be an IOU I be go Clinton the emcee a street kid who could not break his bad habit ¢Ü Life be a Cabaret my friend ¢Ü hey here be my gal now hi be one of you detective Valens I perform on cruise ship these day you would be surprised how high end the production be oh I 've hear they be top notch Nora how do you feel about Dennis honestly I be in love with he must have be hard fall for a guy who be engage to someone else and humiliating once everyone else know about your feeling be that why you shoot he I would never hurt Dennis he be this beautiful open person who see the good in everyone after two month it be like we would always know each other but there be that little problem of his fiancee Dennis do not want to hurt she but after the show 's run he be go to leave she for I really 'cause that be the first we 've hear about it we find ourselves during Cabaret and we find each other we hear you get pretty upset when Nora announce her feeling for Dennis I and every other straight guy there but you be the only one who storm out of the theater I do not storm out of the theater because of my little crush on Nora why then these little drama within the drama always end up hurt the show these actor be give a chance to perform onstage realize a dream and they risk it all for these fleeting emotion but sound like you be suffer some fleeting emotion yourself nothing I would let interfere with the performance so you be pretty dedicated the theater be my life I love it but I know exactly what can happen when emotion start to boil over ¢Ü Lady peaceful ¢Ü ¢Ü lady happy ¢Ü ¢Ü that be what I long to be ¢Ü ¢Ü all the odd be ¢Ü ¢Ü they be in my favor ¢Ü ¢Ü Something 's bind to begin ¢Ü ¢Ü it be get to happen ¢Ü ¢Ü happen sometime ¢Ü ¢Ü maybe this time ¢Ü ¢Ü I will win ¢Ü Good all right great sound check now before we take our break I have an important announcement many of you have hear of Barry Turk my agent in New York do not he represent Deniro that be right and drumroll please he be go to come and see the show next week on opening night and he be tell I that if he see good talent he might sign someone up it will be you the agent sign Nora you 've get that star quality no it will be you you be the talented one you be just so real up there maybe it will be both of we oh hi Gloria hey Lyle make some brownie for the gang you 've all be work so hard that be nice of you thank Dennis I can not imagine life after the play without you we be an amazing team you know that yeah I do be here with you be the only time I be really happy these day I should 've turn off the speaker as soon as she walk into that booth but part of I hope it would explode and I would be the one end up with Nora Gloria make it sound like everything with Dennis be solid no way that woman be furious I think she would kill he then and there do you see she again yeah uh backstage opening night she be upset and look for Dennis ¢Ü be not that long a stay ¢Ü ¢Ü life be a Cabaret ¢Ü what be your problem with musical when be your wedding go to be Gloria we have not decide Huh Most of my girlfriend pick a place soon as they know they be getting hitch unless there be trouble like their fiance 's in love with someone else Gloria we know you be upset and that you go backstage before the show I never even find he see that Nora first and leave ask any of my family they be all there for the big show we can not help if you do not tell we the truth about your relationship I love Dennis but once those rehearsal start I fade into the background to he well why do not you tell we Gloria I do not tell anybody we be engage for five year while everyone here call I a fool and I keep wait for he to commit how could I admit to anyone that it never would have happen ¢Ü how the world can change ¢Ü ¢Ü it can change like that ¢Ü ¢Ü due to one little word ¢Ü all I could think about the whole shift be the opening tonight almost run a couple of curb I have a meeting with the director today so I should leave soon be your girlfriend go to be there what I hear you the other night with that actress I know something be go on nothing happen between I and Nora I swear but you want it to do not you I love you Gloria I really do but I be just a little confused right now obviously I do not want to hurt you but I need some time to think about all this stuff remember when I first get this job I be go to save money and travel maybe go to Australia of course I remember but I never do I never do anything except drive a cab we can travel if that be what you want no I be just say I have not make much of myself and this meeting with the director I know it be suppose to be a secret but I really think that it could make my future a whole lot bright Brighter I do not understand Denny I think we have a really good life together be thing really so dark before I just I know I 've be a disappointment I just do not want to be that anymore you be never a disappointment to I I guess you never really know anyone all the way what be the secret meeting with the director day of the show all Dennis say be that it be with Rafe 's bigwig agent and Nora so I get angry again that be the last time we speak so what be this meeting with Dennis before the show since you leave that out before maybe you can fill we in now I do not think it be important it be simply so Dennis could meet my agent Barry Turk our problem be we call Barry Turk get his client list you be not on it I be once but Barry have not return my phone call in six year so you lie to Dennis and Nora not exactly I mean I would leave another damn message for his assistant I be really hope he would show well he do not I could not tell my actor that I would slip to the b list I need to build myself up in their eye for your own ego absolutely not maybe you be right maybe it be for my own ego whatever it be I be afraid it may have cost Dennis dearly Barry Turk got stick in New York miss the train but he will jump a late one so he will make the show tonight be able to see I and Dennis perform of course be you sure look what be important for you two to keep in mind be that tonight 's performance could decide someone 's future God I be nervous you should be the truth be I have a lot of say over who Barry choose to represent he must really respect your opinion he do and he like to keep a short client list only one new client a year one client that be right well it should definitely be you Nora you be truly gifted you be right Dennis Rafe Dennis be 35 I be just 25 I be the one with a real chance to make it in the business I be the real talent here you know I would work the hard for it I be committed to go all the way no matter what it take what be I think I I almost ruin my life because of you I think a little healthy competition would be good for they I do not think Nora would be so consume by it all consume enough you think she would kill he make sure she get the agent she make it quite clear she be go to be a star no matter what it take so Nora want the spotlight the question be be she desperate enough to kill for it we 've be go through the play memento Rafe give we he tell we Dennis Rushed to a copy place before the show and we find out why Cabaret program a manager there tell we they be about to run it off and Dennis stop they want to change his note Notes each actor have a place where they can write personal stuff to their family and friend Gloria I be sorry if I lose my way in the dark you be the only star that can make my future bright let us set a date since the show never go on Gloria never see the program or know Dennis have come around Clinton I uh I get something I think you people need to hear go ahead I do not say anything before because I I know you would believe she over I but now I get proof Clint this be Nora I know the police have be talk to you and if you tell they what I do that night you will be very very sorry see always bet on the dame your friend Clinton 's in the next room he play we your message oh god yeah you need to tell I what happen Nora I be such an idiot why be I such an idiot do not know but you well start explain I do not want Clinton to say anything because my career be really about to take off and getting convict of murder might get in the way I do not kill Dennis I be innocent hey this be not a performance Nora this be real life and you be in real trouble okay okay I be young and insecure and I let my emotion get the good of I ¢Ü I meet this truly remarkable girl ¢Ü ¢Ü in this really incredible town ¢Ü ¢Ü and she skillfully manage to talk her way into my room ¢Ü oh Cliff ¢Ü I 've get a terrible feeling I 've say a dumb thing ¢Ü ¢Ü besides I 've only get one narrow bed ¢Ü ¢Ü we will think of something ¢Ü you can not be mad at I forever Dennis I be just commit totally that be why I will bet you will be a star I will be drive my cab this be fun but I do not think I like shut off my memory live in the now you forget too much hey they be look for you guy in costume I be go to get ready man I be kind of nervous I do not blame you Rafe tell I Barry Turk want to walk out of here with some new client Cool I think you be so talented thank you but I be afraid Dennis have a well shot he be just more commercial you know well we will see I guess but why take that chance if we mess Dennis up the agent can focus on you and I instead what do you mean mess he up look I know about your background okay the jail time the gang it be all cool with I if you put on a ski mask which they have in the costume room by the way and wait outside until Dennis go for his cigarette break a ski mask just listen okay you could pretend to be a robber take his wallet scare the hell out of he you could use the director 's gun I see that he keep it in his office drawer you want I to shoot Dennis of course not I just want you to rattle he up so he be a wreck onstage then you and I can shine blow that Barry Turk away you be out of your mind nobody gets hurt and we will go to the next level what be crazy about that you know a couple of month ago I would have do it you know that because I would have believe that that be all I be good for but not anymore and if I ever get an agent it be go to be because I put on one hell of show after what Clinton say I realize I be act like a lunatic your plan be exactly how it go down it be a heck of a coincidence I know why do you think I do not want Clinton to talk I know how guilty it make I look but I swear on my life I do not hurt Dennis one of they must have do it it be too detailed a plan unless someone overhear it I be glad to help but I be pretty sure I tell you guy everything I know already I do not think so lyle no no we know you be in that booth for sound check that you could hear everything onstage you hear Nora 's plan the night of the show and you go through with it do not you her plan I have no idea what you be talk about the actor be give a chance to get onstage realize a dream your word that your dream lyle to be onstage come on I love play music but the music be not what people clap for at the end of the show be it that be because they be moron now I think you be a lot like Dennis watch life pass you by dream of a spotlight but Dennis be brave he get up his nerve go out there and audition you be too scared that why you kill he or do you kill he just because you know he be well than you well than I I do not think so oh pretty easy to sit on the sideline judge but you know what I do not think you could 've hack it under those bright light you be wrong if I would get onstage that night with Barry Turk in the front row everyone would 've be blow away but you be never go to get onstage Wrong again with Dennis go I be the only one who could go on in his place I know every word of that show you kill he and think the curtain would still go up I be just go to hit he in the leg send he to the hospital it be not fair they cancel the show whatever happen to the show must go on I know every word every

Account of my checkered past no detail just to keep your distance what do you do they say I shoot my husband and I do too but I have a reason do you kill he just blow up his shoulder he run off after that so why do you come to Smokies huh I come because I believe what you say end of entry she believe what Fannie say when who be Fannie one of the factory girl D'you think she really shoot her husband well find out I will go with ya I would like to meet an 80 year old who shoot a guy I and Alice we start out kinda shaky but then we get along we pull an arrest record from 1940 Fannie not my

that girl you two must have be an odd pair war time make for unusual companion all the man be away and you make friend where you could find they so you and Alice be friend with each other make B 25 's together it kinda bond you do you ever hear her talk about Ivan Sure who be he her cousin in Europe you see her family be jewish she have not hear from Ivan in month which worry she and I tell she she

they up take they off to die I do not believe it neither do I it seem crazy now but most people do not know the truth until the Liberation so Alice be try to help Ivan Smokies ' owner be a portuguese fellar Richard have a contact in the consulate that could be helpful to she for a fee say for 2000 dollar he would smuggle Ivan into Lisbon the amount in the bank acount oh so she get the money any idea how well no thank to her husband so Nelson do know Ivan oh sure and Alice beg he to help but he would not budge Thought you do not know who Ivan be Nelson you forget he be your wife 's cousin no

think he be in danger this one be from Alice June ' 43 ask I for the money tell you what she hear about the camp I be in Europe I never hear such a thing I think it be just gossip that she have pick

never send to the morgue go on well I be there when the warden sign paper say there be in 1968 I have two problem one I be very young and two the prison be very old the governor be not sure either of we be up for the job Hank escape one more time and he be close the place down one more time he would do it twice before in ' 65 and again in late 1967 hmm but you recapture he First eight then another ten year be add to his sentence 20 year for take shoe that be pretty stiff he get two for steal 18 for run in any event once he have disappear from the infirmary I have to look at the big picture so you initiate a phony murder investigation to cover up what you think be a successful escape correct the problem be warden that make believe murder turn out to be a real one be you suggest I have something to do with Hank 's death do you Inmate gets kill during an escape not something I would need to cover up in fact the first time Hank run we should 've kill he there on the south wall get get get get get get get get let us bring he down I 've be try to play the hand I be deal warden I truly have next shot will not be a warning Hank how be it feel way up there on that wall huh Hank boy Lonely Screw your head on son you 've only be here a few month it get easy in two year you will walk out of here why jeopardize that two year might as well be a life sentence go to be long if you do not climb down from there I just I get to get back shoot he Jaden you sorry son of a bitch get the dog out as much as I want to help that boy have I be do the shooting that night I would not have miss

digger how have he do it still try to figure that out you do be oblige you let I know you and Hank share a cell three year you and he must have be close Soul brother so do Hank talk much about how he be go to escape no nothing ever a man better his chance if he keep such plan to himself okay but why escape at all with such a light sentence that Hank have a mind of his own say here you serve six year at Northern State and then transfer here when it close uh huh so that mean for 39 year Bryce Wilbur 's the only warden you 've ever know okay what be your opinion of he tough fair do not play around how about a former guard at Northern State Mike Jaden pretty girl pretty girl that be what we use to call he and not just inmate guard too Hank finish up beat it do you do it I think the boy

cry uncle get to admire that the guy have heart you be suppose to be on the side of the law Lil I can not be on the side of this warden so how do you figure he as the doer Hank die from blunt force trauma this baseball bat could be the murder weapon maybe why he be in the infirmary not pneumonia mm hmm a month later say he die from the injury the warden dump the body in a tunnel no one know about hmm what about this nurse who be treat he Scotty 's pay she a house call Ms Valez I do not mean to be too personal it be okay yeah I would pass the time with Jaden there for a while Aka pretty

finger break and during the month uh Hank be with you the warden ever pay a visit I think the warden do enough do not you anyone come to see Hank only his friend Johnny and he come to help so Hank and

that be what set you apart from the rest of your family ah I and the boss will be wait for you on the other side so Johnny be help Hank escape and I never report it 'cause I would always feel that Hank get a bum deal what about um the boss any idea who that be no but if he be as handsome as Hank and Johnny I would like to meet he Johnny Harkin be parole two week before the Johnny Cash broadcast and leave with the intention of help Hank bust loose turn out Johnny 's granddad Willie Harkin be one of the 12 that build the tunnel in ' 45 so story about the tunnel be pass down over the year and Johnny tell his pal Hank where to find it so Johnny know about the old tunnel why do not he ever try an escape well he be serve five out in three why risk do time you do not have to right do not be like Hank Rush hey Frannie Vay lens get to my bone yet for all I know your dead guy could 've play Rachmaninoff no sign of break or fracture on the finger but Hank 's finger be break with plier would not you be able to see that yes and I be tell you those finger be good as new valen you a little stumped no I get it those be not Hank 's hand so those be not Hank 's bone at all take a load off you do not mind it be your house you like it you uh do a lot with a little now you say it be someone else wear Hank 's prison uniform in that tunnel well we be check dental record but that be what we be think we know Johnny and someone call the boss be help Hank escape okay well you tell we Johnny die so he be not the skeleton right leave the boss but we do not know who that be well as far as the boss go Johnny be not one to take order so there be no one he ever mention by that name oh I do not say that so one day I be out on the stoop and I catch Bobbi come my way she walk real fast not in a hurry you know but with purpose what do you say to her nothing come out oh man I know she just walk on by never look over this keep happen three day in a row finally on day four when I be 'bout ready

Johnny give she that name how be it go over with Hank well Hank be patient with he he know Johnny do not have much story hour help he get by so Bobbi 's the boss Hill say the same Bobbi 's also the Falcon DMV show a Ford Falcon ' 62 sport be register in her name so she and Johnny be go to get Hank out of that tunnel together Falcon be the getaway car thing be we know Bobbi 's still alive so those bone be not the boss 's and we know they be not Hank 's which leave Johnny but he supposedly die in Detroit but maybe not there be no death certificate for a Johnny Harkin in Detroit maybe that knife fight rumor be a sham maybe he die in that tunnel instead so the bone in the tunnel be Johnny where 's Hank where 's Lyle Bobbi he go fish and I be get ready to join he he seem like a nice guy

face that be not necessary why be that between my friend at the Eastline Bank and I we have plenty of dirt on the magnificent Kern family and that make Jeff back off cuz he do not seem to be the backing off type who know what he would have do maybe he die before he know himself or mayb he die so he could not put out that press release maybe but I fight with word not rock for what it be worth I never believe that Jeff die at the hand of a gay man beat he with rock I would look for a heterosexual get one in particular Jeff find out I be gay because we both have friend on the AIDS floor at Penn General I see he there yeah so Artie share a room wih a boy who have AIDS and the boy 's father be rageful Carson Finch Jeff hello hi Sick friend ¢Ü the Scorpions ' still love you ' ¢Ü can I get

week later he be kill not by I I be angry yeah I think Kenny get AIDS from his second grade teacher now I know it be the transfusion he have skateboard accident why would you target Jeff it just seem unfair I mean if there be some miracle my kid should get it not the gay guy what miracle do you mean that guy Jeff say he have a way to get his boyfriend into a drug trial maybe save he how I do not know but they keep argue about it the sick guy say ' it be not worth it I accept my death ' I be think you accept your death great give my kid the drug how do you get access to these drug trial Connections clout know a board member be a major donor to the hospital what hospital be you talk about Penn General they do a lot of research there Jeff 's father 's on the board of director for Pennsylvania General that qualify as a major donor have be for year so Jeff need dad to save Artie 's life potentially only Jeff and dad be estranged but Jeff will do anything he and Artie be in love which be why dad will say no that writer Finch tell Jeff he have something that could ruin his dad maybe Jeff ask he what the dirt be so he could throw it at dad himself we get to talk to the old man whether he like it or not you think a father would kill his son to save his business empire why not Jeff be dead to he already do Jeff come to you for help before he die Mr Kern he call ask if we could meet say it be important I make he beg I be a jerk Dad do not say that sorry if it offend you what happen when you two meet we do not he be murder the night before so you do not know what he want to talk about no and I never will I think Jeff want you to help Artie get into the drug trial at Penn General yes you 've tell I what would 've you say I would 've say no but Artie get into that trial yes after Jeff die I make sure his friend get a place how strange logic maybe it be guilt something you do Mr Kern you have something to say to I say it be a man Carson Finch have dirt on your family Finch be a dilettante Jeff know what it be and be go to use it against you you 've get fire huh just like Jeff do what do Finch tell he what do he hold over you what could be bad than what Jeffrey flaunt everyday Dad it be unnatural let us not go into that the only thing more unnatural be for a father to bury his son hearing of his death be the bad day of my life you should go now yes go you get Artie into that trial may have save his life Furthest thing from my mind I do not believe you Mr Kern I think you love Jeff well he be always my favorite they both be you really think Jeff would blackmail his own father he be not shy about confrontation I suppose that be true he be a chip off the old block you tell he you have something on his family we need to know what it be that be

it that be all it take in those day thing take a steep dive after that Honey you be early here let I take that I go overboard and buy prime rib do not be sore what be it Jenkins suspend I whatever for he hear about the subpoena they can not do that to you but it be do there be a stop on my next paycheck our bill will go past due I know well it be ridiculous it be all a misunderstanding what be you do we do not need prime rib in fact most of these thing we can do without he say it be just temporary I be sure it will all be fine it be not fine I take it he do not get his job back it be the beginning of the end neighbor start to shun we the market would not sell to we how have Elliot handle it he get quiet keep everything inside well you must 've talk about it not really the wall go up between we that be that anyone he might 've open up to our friend Harlan who bring he to that meeting in the first place Harlan Sealey teach at Haverford the irony be I be the dyed in the wool communist Elliot just think integration be an okay idea so why have they go after he first rule of a witch hunt do not limit yourself to the witch or maybe they want to roll he Elliot 's FBI file say they be try to get he to spill who else be at those meeting why do you think he lose his job they be ruthless but somebody kill he the night before he be suppose to testify so whoever he be go to give up might 've have motive oh you do not have to tell I about that be you name More than once but not by Elliot when they be do with I it be 12 year before I could get another teaching job that be rough ah I get off easy the Rosenbergs they pay a real price and Elliot that same night the third execution so you think they be relate we be talk fanatic any fanatic in particular might 've go after Elliot there be an incident at a ball game Polio take my chance for sport but I 've always love to watch hey pop Mr Sealey how you feel Dean o not so hot they be say this pitcher 's throwing fastball right out of the major boy can really hum they in huh he be just about lead the whole world in home run too what do they say about his uniform Uniform well you figure he put it on one leg at a time yeah yeah I will bet he do maybe if you swing a hair soon you might put some wood on the ball Hey Garvey you miss the sign on the way in no parking on the grass no hooch on the field and no red in the bleacher that be bunk Wade let I put it simple we do not want your boy on the field with ours come on this be screwy you be already a disgrace to the country do not be one to your own kid go on son go warm up you be cruise for a bruise pinko Dad Come on let us just go no we stay you well look around not a soul here be go to stand behind you he take Dean and leave I would have do the same Ribble mean it he be an ignorant violent man but when Elliot be kill you do not report this Ribble guy to the police that would have be pointless Wade Ribble be the police Wade Ribble have some IAB file excessive force false imprisonment animal cruelty shot the neighbor 's dog Nice but you well have evidence before you accuse a cop of murder you be the one thought they pull up short on the case boss that be a far cry from sweep a homicide under the rug hey boss Morning what about the other angle People at the meeting have a lot to lose if Elliot name they when he testify that make the timing of his death pretty conspicuous you get name Sealey give we a few all of whom be dead ditto for Ribble but there be a restraining order in the file from a lawyer name Bloodworth tell officer Ribble to step off Elliot Martin Bloodworth you know he I know he he die last year if they be draw up paper it be serious it be not the kind of thing his wife would forget Wade Ribble be a menace and we obviously could not go to the police about he so your lawyer file the restraining order yes and look into his whereabouts the night Elliot die what have he find out Ribble be in Harrisburg at the

swipe the cash take over as lead prosecutor after Greg die win the case make he a household name in New Haven Huh now he be on the political track it could 've be Vizcaino 's future if someone have not shank he oh maybe there be your motive let us start with Mott see why he be say that Vizcaino stold the money a roadtrip to New Haven Job go to spring for Howard Johnson 's Sure but the boy get to bunk together Junior guy get the cot no way that be the know fact we call he ' Golden Greg ' good look smart as a whip a guy yet you tell the New Haven register that this great guy stold that money look I hate to tarnish his name but when it be suggest I take it I be push to the wall but why would Greg do that take the 10 grand I would not speculate about that good guess Greg be not himself at the end how be that the Hall case be the big league a white jogger rape and kill by a latino kid it be a slam dunk until the kid recant his confession then it get tough and Greg could not take it it be his first time as lead prosecutor he start out great but he lose focus yeah how at work he be all over the map pull vice report make weird phone call he he just seem distracted by something other than the case you ask he about it Nah he be first chair I be not suppose to question he he ever mention Philadelphia Hmm no but he would disappear for hour at a time maybe he go there but so middle of his case he would go awol and you have no idea where to I know where he go one time if this get out it be a pandora 's box though it will not get out the day before he disappear Greg do something that any law student would tell you be incredibly unethical I just hear from the prison ward at county yeah they say that you visit Antonio last night I say that have to be wrong Harold I know what I be do you visit the defendant without his lawyer present you know what this could do to our case right you know you could be disbar it be under control it be fine Fine Greg what be go on nothing where be you go I get to be some place we be in the middle of a trial and I be first chair tell you I got to be some place I know what I be do I do not care what Greg say he be drown and the next day he be dead Antonio be the guy you be prosecute serve a life sentence now real tough luck kid try suicide in jail before trial so you never tell anyone about Greg 's visit would 've lead to a mistrial and you would not make the front page Antonio confess to rape and murder but recant public defender get involve it be always this strategy bottom line I be not go to let that kid walk because Greg be crackin ' up what do you think happend to Greg he be a striver and on his way but he be not ready for the job and be proud he would not ask for help so he self destruct whole thing be an american tragedy Detective Jefferys and Vera Antonio Philly cop huh I do not like talk to police we get to ask you about Greg Vizcaino the lawyer that die in the middle of your trial be not I I be lock up well

wife die well I 've be where you 've be yeah I know so if you ever want to talk guess you will let I know Jerry Stone Twenty four die in the ring after go 15 round with Maurice Mad Mo Bell Autopsy show massive swelling on the brain as cause of death so no question the punch he take kill he Top Dog box Club December 19 1976 Rocky versus Apollo the real thing hmm what be that about the idea of the fight be to try and recreate ' Rocky ' the hot movie at the time sort of gimmicky huh ha supposedly it live up to the hype ' till someone got kill Nick the other fighter Mo be he question first time around the assign put he through his pace but boxer die in the ring what be you go to do but know the referee be on the take that change everything so we figure out who pay Sonny maybe Gina will know who be that Sonny 's daughter and Jerry 's girlfriend say here she be ringside when Jerry die so Gina look on as her own dad allow her boyfriend to get beat to death maybe it explain why she be not ringside today she be not at the hospital Start with her Jerry be short on talent Big on heart he say that be why they pick he for the fight because they know he would never quit no matter how badly he be hurt no he would stay in and take the punishment like Rocky do now you add a referee who be willle to let that happen Gina any idea on who could have pay your dad that money no well how about someone who have a problem with Jerry besides Sonny you mean yeah Nah so Sonny do not care for Jerry at fifteen he make it very clear that I be not to see he he say he be a bum how so he drop out of school do not work but he could always hustle up money to drink so how do you two get together just another Friday night go nowhere and then I see something my father could not ¢Ü Orleans Dance with I ¢Ü drink those egg be so gross what about his apartment yeah that too be not that Jerry Stone Shh hi Jerry hey oh my gosh what happen to your face my face Gina here can not stop look at it okay hey I will see you in a minute so do you like the movie uh the love story part you sorta look like Adrian I do I I 've see the flick three time yeah fifteen buck for a locker and a corner man five dollar charge for shower and towel Hmm very true to life so uh my look be comin ' on huh I say you look different that be all yeah 'cause I feel different oh this movie 's get I think if some bum want to be president in the United States he really can be President huh ha ha well I guess I would well work one of the few fight first my record 's not so hot I get to go do my roadwork Jerry ah be you look for your own Adrian be you for real uh huh so that be the beginning of I and Jerry and the end of you and Sonny yeah I tell he that Jerry have change I say there be no stop he now but Sonny do not believe it Gina just so you know your dad be genuinely sorry about Jerry yeah too bad he do not feel that way before he let Mad Mo kill he Detective will Jefferys Mo and my partner detective Vera where you all park car man up on the corner we be good Yo Booger some good look out for Philly 's fine you snug as a bug now baby let us talk about Jerry Stone come on at the weigh in you say you be go to murder Jerry for real and you do hey hey hey just talk bad man sell up ticket what about the press conference when you be talk about some black and white stuff ah just point out the difference our people be into James Brown Jerry Stone and you all might have rather be square dancing not any racist it be a little bit still it do not mean I murder he Mo we look into your juvenile record arrest nine time before you be fifteen two year in the lockup for put step pop in coma those record be suppose to be seal do not worry we tape them back up I did't even know who Jerry Stone be I I do not want to take that fight in the first place why not Cat be what 15 18 3 something terrible like that what be beat a chump like that go to do for I so why do you fight he Tommy Sugar the promoter of the fight Man could sell you a house in the Atlantic Ocean ¢Ü Parliament give up the Funk ¢Ü that be he in the maroon trunk do not nobody care about these cat what no no what wait a minute look how many fight you 've win in a row all of'em and 21 out of 22 be knockout and what one of them be against a top five contender hey be not no top five give I a fight man you wanna know why why Publicity you be a wreck machine but nobody know you but if I get down with this fight they will and fight this fool 's go to raise my status come on let I introduce you to one of the great bleeder of all time Jerry Stone I 've opende up face many a time but if he bleed like this tonight imagine what you will do to he it be like you say nobody care about this cat I know I do not but everybody be go to care about you yeah come on Mo huh yeah yeah yeah so you agree to the fight and take Jerry apart the ref should 've stop I could tell why the boy 's brain get wet I be kill he and he be holler he take the ring back this kinda nonsense the thing be Mo your career do not rise it go downhill after that fight kill somebody have a way of throw a man off track not for Tommy Sugar he be be Phily 's top boxing promoter the last 25 year well that be some truth and here be some more the night Jerry Stone die Tommy Sugar be bear it be 1976 the bicentennial and ' Rocky ' be as american as it get and you see a way to exploit that see opportunity for one and all that kind of timing do not come twice so the pressure be on this fight have to live up no doubt one thing for an underdog to go 15 round on the silver screen another to make that happen in real life I tribute to the young man who fight and you do nothing to help it along like what Jerry would bleed a lot which be a good thing right but if you be try to remake ' Rocky ' you need Jerry to go 15 round so you do not want too much of a good thing so maybe as insurance you pay the referee to keep it go no matter what well Sonny take a deal like that Yep ha ha ha I wish I have know he be open for business you know where you ought to be look be the c Y o Catholic Youth Organization where I pluck Jerry from a half a dozen fighter come to I cry the blue after be overlook so one of these sore loser from the c Y o pay Sonny 1 500 dollar to see Jerry take the beating of his life your good fighter always hold a grudge the c Y o be at it be height in the 70 's instead of a kid suck on cigarette all day long he have a place to go and Jerry Stone participate in the boxing program Jerry would serve mass for I on Sunday morning and then fight for I on Sunday night which eventually land he this bout with Mo right hear not everyone be overjoy by that you got to be remember that these kid have their nose press right up against it and along come Jerry he be get a chance at a real professional fight anyone so jealous they might wanna see real harm come to Jerry pay the ref off to see that happen ah deep down these guy know they be not well than Jerry just a bunch of ham and egger except uh one of them I guess who Bucky Lowsen good fighter we have well than Jerry they want more of an underdog he have too good a record and how have he deal with that Bucky do not like come in second to Jerry that seem to be happen quite a lot ¢Ü Marshall Tucker Band can not you see ¢Ü hey can I borrow the key to the gym father I want to work the bag a little Mr Carroll must think Rome be build in a day hey go play some record I will be right over you just will not give he a chance will you why should I a bum be a bum be a bum hey hey I 've look for you Buck do not ' buck ' I boy you get the message I leave you look Buck this be Mr Sugar 's fight you should talk to he I do my only way in that ring be if you be out I be sorry I be stay put Hey sucker we be not through here Buck Buck back off you want to start a donnybrook start with I Fine hey Sonny you see Jimmy the jeweler lately what be you talk about Jerry purchase a fancy engagement ring seem to think he be marry Gina Bucky give it a rest maybe you fight Mo be not such a bad thing after he put you in a coma guess whose brawny shoulder 's go to be there for Gina to cry on so Buck and Gina have history sweetheart in high school Elementary he have be carry a torch for she since the fifth grade how do you know that well around here if you do not get the story on some kid after the mass you believe your butt you would at the bar so between lose both the fight and the girl to Jerry Hmm Buck be have a rough go Alright Scotty I will see you then Valens yeah he alright We'er go to grab some drink Good do well than yesterday you talk to he yeah Buck Lowson 's get a record two day before the fight Buck rob a convenient store this say he be arrest in ' 78 not ' 76 it take that long to catch he how much do Buck get away with two thousand and a thing of peanut butter and two whole year to spread it around yeah but maybe only take two day before he burn all 1 500 of it right fifteen hundred Sonny 's ask price I do not know what you be talk about Buck I might even believe you if not for the timing I mean you never steal anything else in your life that be the god 's honest truth nothing before that day or after but that day be the problem Buck because it be two day before the fight how do you explain that I can not start with the money what d'you do with it Buck we know you wish Jerry ill and that you and Gina go way back let he call a lawyer I don ' want a lawyer I can not afford one Fine I will make sure you get a pd if you be lucky you might even get a good one you think a public defender 's go to care about I Alright maybe not but Buck if you be not go to talk about the money what be we suppose to do besides if you be so innocent what be you hedge for because I do not wanna hurt her ¢Ü Bachman Turner Overdrive you be not see nothing yet ¢Ü hey Buck what be you do here well what be you do here I be wait for Jerry he be run too oh so suddenly he be humping early morning run huh um hmm Priceless well Buck here he be so relax he be not go to see we look get his head in the cloud what a clown he could run these step like Rocky all day it be go to mean zip no he be be work real hard Gina the fix be in what Mo 's take a dive first round Jerry 's go to win it will not be a real fight that will hurt Jerry real bad hey there be nothing you can do about except take advantage what do you mean you know what the odd be for Jerry win in a first round knockout what twenty to one that be why I be not bust Balboa 's bubble just yet there be some real dough to be make first Gina could not resist a sure thing she be a gambler I rob that store so I could get her bet money do you tell she how you get it no I want to impress she not tell she I be scum have it bad for her huh Buck my whole stupid life so Gina act all break up for Jerry that the fight be go to be a fake but dry her eye pretty quick and place her own bet on it hey boss can I talk to you for a minute Scotty hey sure what happen in that interview be 100 the wrong way I mean thump on anybody do not matter who you can not do it okay I assure you it will not happen

on that fight yeah I do you take the dough from Buck and the twenty to one odd that come with it thirty to one by the time I place my bet Hmm could not resist it huh have a bit of a problem so all that talk about Jerry 's big heart and how there be no stop he just word no but why should all the other shlub make money off of Jerry and not we so you do it for the both of you yeah why be we go to believe you because I do tell Jerry and it cost I Nervous about tomorrow no no well not like tonight what be so big about tonight ¢Ü Elton John someone save my life Tonight ¢Ü well what do you say Jerry Mo 's go to fall down on the first round you be go to win what be you joke I or not we be go to make some money be you say you put a bet down Baby just go along with it there be nothing that you can do it be all set huh Jerry this be our chance we can get out of this stink neighborhood what by be a bum that be exactly what I be try not to be I think you believe in what I be do Jerry we be stuck and when we be fifty we will still be stick we be not go to get a break like this again we will make our own break you really believe that that be why I want this fight to prove it I guess I should take that back we see it all so different now Hmm short engagement to make matter bad I have to go talk Frank Shavers what I have do who be Shavers from the old neighbohood I work in his bingo parlor if anyone have a bet on this fix it be he so you tell he that Jerry know about it and to take his bet back before it be too late what do he say there be no take bet back so Frank you 've be big money on this fix then Gina open up her mouth to Jerry I be not please so do you retaliate how would I have do that how about pay the referee 1 500 buck to not stop the fight no matter how bad off Jerry be get I what Jerry end up maim or dead the boxing world get the message do not mess with Frank Shavers Ha ha ha I be not a thug I be a businessman and it be a bad day at the office so you never tamper with Sonny I never suspect anyone have until now we be listen Jerry last fifteen round that be incredible really but what be more incredible be only one person bet on Jerry to do just say there you go Frank it finally hit ya huh what be that three year from now Mo Bell may be heavyweight champion of the world that be what you be tangle with there be no shame in know when to walk away no it be the same in respect to Gina return the ring Jerry let my daughter be Drink in the night before the fight put it down every reflex have to be right your mind clear Father it do not matter anymore

need you in that ring Father Son I 've raise you from a pup if you will not do it for yourself do it for I so father need Jerry to go the distance that night seize Jerry 's wobbly I do not stick around but Father be huddle up with Sonny when I leave maybe father buy some insurance from he make sure his ' pup ' get to the finish line put money on Jerry not to win but to make it fifteen round that be a pretty specific bet father that be because Jerry set that goal for himself I think he could make it and your winning must 've be sweet I 've throw in the towel for Pete 's sake yeah with twenty second remain because of what I see in his eye Jerry always look bad but this time I could see he be cook or maybe throw that towel be just an act Huh father look I can not force you two to believe I do you know the fight be fix fix Mo make a deal to let Jerry to win in the first round and Jerry know about it no kidding but do not wanna go along with it I would not think he would and if

Cedric Browing Rodney what be your fight with he about Excuse at the park the night of the murder you be hassle each other that be a personal dispute he be in my face cuz his woman be cast they ferrochrome my way and you be not wave they off maybe it be he Cedric be not the shooter he be sell peanut at Phillies game that night you get into lot of domestic dispute Rodney with boyfriend husband maybe I try not to mess with the married lady try I fail on occasion one in particular guess it do not make no difference now who dead girl 's mum Jessie Mr Witherspoon I be Witherspoon who want to know Philly PD Philly PD huh whatever it be I do not do it we hear you sell a weapon to a kid name Pate back in ' 93 ' 93 it be possible I have a small problem with the grain industry back

sure because I 've be with he for the last 18 year do not you think he would 've mention it by now unless he have a reason not to he do not know and you can not tell he promise I sorry Jessie I can not do that why why should he suffer now because I be a fool 18 year ago because I be lonely and selfish do you know Rodney have other woman I be stupid not blind you see he with someone else that day

Cincinnati the night she die you can check we will I be truly sorry when I hear about Nancy never believe it Suicide I mean why be that something be go on in that house something strange well Bruce my advice be simple to a young poet let nothing come between you and the page be that why you prefer write everything longhand Professor the true connection really because when the muse speak to you she do in a whisper or a scream pardon I I do not know what make I say that could it be your muse be a banshee of course I do not write not really not like my husband do actually Nancy be a voracious reader seem she be read nearly every book in my library oh and somehow manage to make delightful pig in a blanket I well check on Rachel excuse I please Nancy grow up an orphan so she get a late start on the great work but it be just make she curious about all that she be miss speaking of great work I hear that your collection be come out next spring my editor pay you to say that do not he well it

to be discreet his wife 's problem you see he say it must 've be a misunderstanding some misunderstanding I respect he so I never speak of it again been hold out on we Professor Kinda thing make we suspicious what be you talk about Forgot to uh clue we in on the dinner party the noose in the attic do not make a lot of sense you keepin ' that quiet it do not mean anything really someone break into your house string up a noose do not mean anything I could not believe it at the time and after she die what about then it only make matter bad why because you do not do anything to stop it no because I believe she we need to go to the police and tell they what there have to be some rational explanation for this someone be in our house you see it with your own eye what more do you want it just do not make any sense I mean who would do a thing like that I do not know I be so scared Daniel you be always go and I be leave here alone what do you expect from I I expect you to believe I I do I be sorry we will go to the police together you give I the key I will drive um what what be the matter Nancy you buy rope I do not understand Daniel Nancy Patterson that be your signature I do not I I I do not buy that do do I Nancy buy the rope I want there to be another explanation and when you come to I I think maybe there be Cops have it right the first time Nancy do herself in so we 've be

Looney Tunes make he up hey hey hey hey hey can not you read since when be milk private property save it all right for what Apple pie maybe just keep your hand off of it Most of the woman in this book just do not seem like the type to leave without say good bye be not you forget the suicide note it be not hers or her husband 's or the housekeeper 's or Bruce 's so who write it it be not an exact science oh that be your explanation drop it Scotty it be bad enough we rock the boat with the family you know she do not write that note Nick this be not about you Scotty or Esasa or be it you be talk

Chandler Housing Projects would have displace hundred of poor resident Dex speak out against that during the campaign Mulwrey figure he would buy Dex 's silence but the next day Dex hold a press conference denounce the Chandler redevelopment so Dex take the man 's money and screw he a day later Mulwrey come out of the construction business Waste management play by different rule you hit he he hit back with a vengeance this use to be the Chandler Housing Project right pull that eyesore down three year ago feel good to give back I be sure you relocate all the people who got displace too the city contract I to redevelop here yeah 'cause you pay them off but not everyone toe the line Dex Collins for example give he a lot of money to back off only he screw you to the wall with a press conference almost end this cash cow it be call the cost of do business as you can see I end up on top and Dex end up dead Dex and I be straight first time in the history of Philly politic that a candidate actually give money back Dex return the 50 grand Guy be sincere I will give he that but a bit too naive for his own good because he be on the up and up because he do not know that his campaign manager be take cash from everyone and put it on the street Cassie Michaels tell we they never take a penny of street money well then she lie I do not care how charismatic you be in ward politic the boss do not lift a finger without getting pay Cassie go behind his back the guy run his whole campaign on do thing different he just do not know what the other hand be do so he give you

benefit right but the relationship change we go in different direction yet you drop everything when he call okay what do you want I to say you want I to say that I still have a thing for Dex so what if I do it have to be tough he want you in his camp just not on his arm not in his neighborhood at least you know in my experience top motive for murder love and money I do not kill Dex which be bad Cassie getting fire or dump I be protect he from himself Dex be a saint but he never understand saint do not win election we be about to take down the most powerful member of the city council that would not happen without street money you do not get it Cass it do not count if we play by their rule say who where be it write that Dex Collins can not work the system the system 's break I be try to

night he uh be murder you always punch your way through rough patch look I regret the hell out of that but I do not hurt Luke must 've be jealous he get the scholarship instead of you you kiddin ' I I would not touch Maynard Green with a hundred foot pole so why do Maynard security log show you trespass two day before Luke be kill there I be ask you a question answer it or what kid see you cuff you answer it downtown instead Maynard be like quicksand I be try to pull Luke out Hey Luke what the hell you do here Ronnie you know I get to drop the apology bomb man you be never home so for what that schoolgirl punch yeah so we cool we be cool look I get to get to class wait a second you high what no Dextroamphetamine no you be not high Luke I only use ' embefore tournament to stay awake man we use to bust on those Maynard speed freak give them back Dr Melanie Banks you get the main line connection now huh anything to give you an edge right I say give them back I get debate every night get to travel every weekend got to keep up my GPA for the scholarship you make excuse now 'cause that doctor should be shoot for even give you those Come on Luke it be I man it be my problem let I fix it all right come on with I son oh no black man on campus got to get the cuff Son I tell you you can not come on campus without an I d badge I have never see Luke like that the drug be not a long term thing no way his dad be on whiskey and painkiller for his back before Maynard Luke would not sip a beer why do not you come forward after Luke die to say what cop say it be suicide his dad be already a wreck I be not much well what about that doctor prescribe the pill I do not know that be the last time I see he maybe he try to fix that problem after all anything off Luke 's debate note I 've be pound my head against the wall still get nothing that be a lot of nothing Everything Luke write the day he die I call every coach in town still can not translate half of it some of this shorthand nobody know what about the symbol from the threat letter I match them but I can not translate them Luke use a couple of they here and here Luke know that code Question be who else do find Melanie Banks psychiatrist practicing in Colorado but in ' 99 she be married to Coach Darren be she write the team prescription no her husband be steal her prescription pad get well she remember Luke show up at their apartment two day before he die those drug get out in the open Darren lose his job and he be look at jail time some people will do anything to keep a secret hey Coach these night shift be kill I get anything to help think some dextroamphetamine might do the trick okay okay look you should know that my ex wife have nothing to do with that I take a few slip from her prescription pad to help Luke out by give he speed they hand Ritalin out like vitamin he just need more hour in his day Kid ever come to your house to my house no wrong answer Ex wife say he be there Friday before he die he come to confront you yes but not about the pill that be just the tip of the iceberg what be you do here the tournament 's at 7 30 in the morning I get to give these back do not they help help I realize what be wrong with how we debate at Jefferson I use to enjoy do this discuss idea now it be just about crank on these pill so I can crush everybody with research I be not who I be anymore you 've win four tournament in a row I mean that be well than any Maynard team ever do but what be the point if I do not care about anything that I be say there be two education system in this country one for the have another for the not wait you write a new case you 've be read Freire this be pretty complex stuff Most of these debate kid have no idea how the other half live why the poor stay poor why my dad could not even think about college and we be go to teach they I be debate the future leader of America right if we can change the way we talk about education yes but you and Alyssa be win big tournament with the old case we can be national champion with this one because I believe in it you ever read any Foucault there be a piece of evidence here that be go to make your case even strong I 've be push debater my whole career and that be the only time a debater push I so how have Alyssa feel about the new case she agree to it they have some kind of argument at the tournament about what I ask she she do not want to talk about it look the drug thing be really stupid but I could lose my job if people find out you should have think about that before you give them to Luke my dad use to be a cop back then people respect their service they do not sweat the small stuff I wish he use to bring home carton of cigarette fruit toy for we all of it fall off a truck sound pretty sweet not like today huh where everybody be up in your business about everything Fit as a fiddle you get your hearing you get your vision and you get your look I can see why you be so popular around the station just promise I you will eat an apple once in a while all right Scout 's honor hey a package show up for you something from Elkayam Jewelers yeah yeah I 've be wait on that check this out this be Luke 's last round I get it from the tournament archive you know what forget it I do not need this evidence look here be what I be try to say the neighbohood I come from no one get the opportunity you all do I get out because I be smart or whatever but you should not have to be a genius to get a decent education People like my father deserve well if you be look for evidence put away your pen I be my own evidence I know this might sound strange but I would like to have a real conversation now look familiar Alyssa write that threat right in the middle of their round her flight make it into the air a few hour ago get a car wait at the airport give she a nice warm Philly welcome I tell the other police this be a mistake I 've be in Paraguay for two week building well ever shoot a gun Alyssa I will not even touch one if you spend one day in a refugee camp save the world one life at a time want to explain this I do not remember much about debate that be a lifetime ago but you write it do not you why would I want to kill someone you tell we you give it to Luke the night he die Luke Cronin kill himself yeah after he blow your last round Pembrook be a local tournament we go three and three with a new case it be no big deal Thought you do not remember much headspace you be in back then lose must have seem like the end of the world if he have just tell I what he be go to do but he do not Luke be so good at move forward he never see who he leave behind be you insane do you know who our judge be no calm down that be Steve Tanner Mr Dartmouth Debate my only way into that school what be you talk about you be graduate from Maynard Green your parent have a gazillion dollar I be get C s you understand I bet everything on debate you tell I you have a s can not keep up with debate and class I be not as smart as you okay it be not a competition now you go off script and you pull out your sob story and yeah it be obvious that I can play backup on the Luke Cronin Show so you write I a death threat you blow my shot at Dartmouth you think go to Ivy be the only way to make people listen they will listen now if you get something worth say you hypocrite you be go to fix the system for guy like your dad right that be why I write this case you care so much about he you never even see he 'cause I be try to win like everybody else just use different word but all that you care about be that judge you be right only one who can judge you be you after Luke 's suicide everything he say sink in Thought it be my punishment for treat he like that only one who can judge you be you after Maynard I do some volunteer work and I get my priority straight what do these other symbol mean the one no one can translate we use our own shorthand so that the other team could not read it it say you do not belong here go back to Oak Lane I still can not believe I write that do not worry we have a way you can make up for it ATF report come back on the 38 that kill Luke track it to a gun show in Delaware purchase by Stan Cronin July ' 97 I guess Luke 's father do not hate gun as much as he say what be it you tell Luke only one who can judge you be you good advice I ever give he you be just full of wisdom be not you back feel well these day yes mostly it be kind of strange a psychiatrist fix your back he moonlight as a chiropractor do not know what you be talk about I call the VA hospital the

please do something because I want my husband back come on you remember when we got marry that first deployment it be nine month remember and we agree if we could survive that we could survive anything no matter what do you still believe that answer one question who be it I tell he and he walk right out the door last time I ever see he Night he die my entire life come down to one stupid decision I would give anything to take it back who be it Kristen the man you be see Mike ' boss sergent Gomez you familiar with the term Jody First Sergeant Gomez it be what we call a man or woman who be cheat with a spouse of a soldier who be overseas it can not get much low than that right but you do not even have the decency to wait for Mike to deploy before go after his wife where be the honor in that there be none I make a mistake about the affair what about the murder you and Kristen get your story straight say the same thing about Mike when he die he be distant tense not himself I do not lie about that Mike Mike be suffer and your answer be to get he out of the way so you could have his wife to yourself you recognize this order for deployment to Iraq for Mike Donley who process they

with Tim not really be a father try to turn it around that be not what you think when you file for sole custody you say that he get Tim out of school take he to Baltimore then leave he there it take I two hour to drive up there and get he I find he in a warehouse all by himself Mick tell you what happen he say he got hurt in the match but unless you be dead it be no excuse right that be a lot of time and money to get sole custody enough to make you want to take matter into your own hand I be work the night Mick be kill check it out I do you take a two hour break right around the time Mick be shoot I sneak off to see my son he be in the hospital for a broken arm broken arm who tell you that he be in a coma for five day a coma why look Ma have nothing to do with it okay you see she tell

of call message anyone talk to Nick in the past 24 there be a recent call on his cell to Jeanette Peterson Billingsley 's ex wife Miller and jeffrie be head over to talk to she now also call to a Goran Petrovic a professor over at Temple one yesterday and one last week correspondence record at rockford Show billingsley write multiple letter to the same dr Petrovic what kind of professor Chemical engineering also work for multiple company that serve private military supplier hit the campus pay the doc a visit you talk to criminal intelligence oh yeah we get team of plainclothe cop try to track he down all right tell they no paper trail I just say find he bring he in no question ask yeah do not take no for an answer from Nick and scotty get that damn car back use to design all sort of nasty explosive with military application Lucrative yes but also insane I prefer teach Detective vera ask you to review the J D Billingsley case give that he be the original investigator and seem quite desperate yes I take a look well the fire marshal determine that it be arson which frankly I find stunning though I should not anymore why be that Most fire marshal only have high school degree and certify after one 40 hour course in fire investigation Ray crawford be be on the job 30 year he be do hundred of arson case Instincts and experience be no substitute for scientific method and this finding completely ignore it what do you tell detective Vera I tell he the truth from the photo it appear that the fire reach upwards of 1 800 degree Flashover from the accelerant not necessarily the temperature be affect mostly by ventilation but what about the burn pattern and the the puddle configuration under the bed the effect of flashover can look like evidence of arson but these burn pattern be not indicative of an accelerant so how do the fire start that be hard to tell from these picture tt appear that the point of origin be most likely the kitchen but you can not say for sure what cause it not for certain which why I be baffle by the fire marshal 's finding oh crawford be be at it a long time he learn from the old timer might explain why it be base on uh junk science and old wife ' tale yeah but Joe Don he escape with no burn on his foot how be that possible because fire burn upward and one that reach flashover be the next hot thing to hell and unless you be confront with that type of heat you just can not understand it detective you be right I do not he leave his kid inside as soon as he go outside to find another way in he just let in more oxygen feed the beast even a fireman would not go back into this blast furnace so what you be say be it be possible Joe Don be tell I the truth I see no evidence of arson that be good right if he be not already dead seem to take the news pretty hard you think the fire start in the kitchen old house like that nine time out of ten it be faulty wiring yeah but there be no way to tell for sure usually there would be some prior issue with overloaded circuit brown outlet but you would have to ask somebody who live in the home Joe don getting kill all these detective come round here again it be like the nightmare never end Detective vera come by here yesterday ask I all those question about thing I would rather not relive go over your statement I do not care to but I trust detective Vera Joe Don be pretty upset when I move out he lose his job drink too much he just he be not the same man I marry I file for separation and then he he find out I be date he threaten you or the kid he say some pretty terrible thing but um I could not deny the boy their father you know when they tell I that he set the house on fire I could not believe it you know nobody should experience a loss like that Jeanette do detective Vera ask you anything else about the house he keep ask about when I live in the house about the kitchen he say he have never let another man raise his boy I lose everything Jeanette I need to ask you about the time before you leave when you still live in the house do you remember any electrical problem with the light or the outlet what problem do not the house have Lights be always flicker on and off do you tell your landlord cheap bastard never fix anything do you remember any problem with the wiring in the kitchen the switch or the outlet why be you ask I this he be dead my kid be go it be important why I do not know how to say this but it be possible Joe Don do not set that fire you must be joke you be the one who tell I he do it the police the fire department the lawyer it have to be true I be not so sure anymore well I do not have any doubt detective you tell I how a man do not run back in there to save his own son the neighbor they see he on the street while my baby burn up how could he not go back in there tell I that those be your kid would you stand outside while they burn alive Jeanette what be wrong with the wiring in the house you know every time you would plug in the toaster the fridge would go out in the kitchen one time the outlet melt down I lose a bunch of breast milk Joe don finally call an electrician and the landlord get all upset about it the landlord Bela he only want to use his handyman to fix everything on the cheap look I I do not understand why you keep ask I about the house should talk to insurance company I be still try to get they to pay up oh that be get to be rough on you Bela yeah I should not have rent to that family now that man be alcoholic it be always bad when man of house can not hold on to job Understand that house have a lot of electrical issue issue no issue you can not put blame on I for what happen oh we do not say that Bela maybe we should talk to your handyman why you detective keep harass I so what happen when Joe Don hire his own electrician oh that stupid waste of money you know how much electrician charge per hour yeah sound like you need one Joe don be problem tenant always overload circuit clog up pipe ask for more time before pay rent always no the way we hear it your handyman could not fix anything there be old wiring light flicker Browning outlet and you send over a guy who can not screw in a lightbulb that be ridiculous Jorge be very good handyman I know he personally Joe Don 's ex tell we a kitchen outlet melt he tell they just plug it into the bottom that your idea I be not negligent I have lawyer who can prove this sure you do look I manage three apartment building People always want something for nothing never mind if it be a fire hazard I do not start that fire this be not my fault oh yeah it be it be nobody 's fault hey call just come in get a jumper at 12th and Ridge it be two block up from Nick 's place white male 40 heavyset no i d Nada Face be mess up from the swan dive six
