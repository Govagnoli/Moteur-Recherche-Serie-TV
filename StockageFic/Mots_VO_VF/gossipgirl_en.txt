that be before kickoff but yep God why can not I look away seriously uh so what be you go to about nate be you go to tell he how can I he would most likely freak out oh there be no question about that and I can not confront catherine because the butler will remember I and and she will drop the dime on the captain sorry that be the only chance I will ever get to talk like that how can I use this to get nate off the hook I mean what do I do well you be you be not go to like it Blair Blair Mm hmm I can not trust blair well maybe not but google revenge you get blairwaldorf Com look she she help I

be that what you think I be do well you tell mml if if I have lunch with someone else tomorrow be blair 's minion go to break her finger just so you know if this be a competition I would not need blair and her posse to win hey hey be not you suppose to not be talk to I or you will be shun or something I do not like bully oh so my question what be we do tonight I be so sorry blair like I say catherine know where the captain be she threaten to expose he if I er take nate away from her but with this I be hope that you might be able who else know what who be see this Dan just dan if you or humphrey ever breathe a word of this one word to anyone you will regret it for the rest of your life do you understand I just want nate free from catherine I do not want he or anyone else find out about this Good I will take care of it I be trust you blair like you have a choice oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh so be you sure you want to eat here 'cause this be uh I be think this be maybe not a great idea why everyone come here Dan it be time to send a message I be not share my lump crab check it out be his business but when he bring his new maiden to court I can not believe he bring she here it

eleanor promise that I could be in the meeting with the buyer from bendel 's and barney today just like she introduce you to the guy from bloomingdale 's Look come here okay no stop Jenny come here agne oh my god I do not have time for this what just look at this okay I mean seriously this can be an ad campaign yeah that do look pretty cool I mean right and look you can do whatever you want to do but I mean what do you think people will say when they see that jenny humphrey 's finally go on her own I do not know jenny humphrey 's so young to have her own line or too bad jenny humphrey 's stuff look exactly like eleanor waldorf 's Blair waldorf in brooklyn you two be you two lose will you talk to her please I there be nothing to talk about I tell you it be over she stop listen to I maybe she will listen to you um sure I be go to go check out the art in the art gallery talk oh she be back wow this be look complicated do not worry you walk in on surgery halfway through it look like murder can I help you know how to weld um I 've see flashdance several time you and chuck have be toy with each other forever so you do not win this one you ever think maybe you should just I do not know let it go this be different why do you do you love he wow someone love chuck bass I do not know I just I I do not understand how it get to this place you know the first time that I tell serena I love she uh it be terrify I 've never feel so expose but the feeling that I get when she say it back to I uh be probably the single great moment of my life but you break up do not mean I would not do it all over again if I say it he win and if he win then I will just be another girl to he you do not know that that be true you have to decide what be most important to you keep your pride and get nothing or take a risk and and maybe maybe have everything well I almost lose a finger in the process I might be permanently cross eye but I do it thank you you look like hell you should go home uh the buyer be go to be here any minute yeah I know that be why I be go to need every moment alone to figure out what the hell be I go to do this dress be a mess it be not my fine work but I would not call it a mess the seam be not finish the zipper gape and and you finish the hem on the machine I tell you that once the machine eat my fabric I have to start all over stop lie to I I know where you be last night Laurel catch the intern look at picture of you and agne out at some trashy bar look I be sorry I think I could still get it do in time you want to be a grow up and have a real job you have to accept real responsibility and the consequence for your action when you do not come through I should 've know well than to give so much responsibility to a child a a child I be sorry but this child seem to be the only one that can design anything that the buyer be remotely interested in this be not about that dress you be use that dress as an excuse because you be scared that if I be in that meeting and meet someone important that they will want to be in business with I and not you you be lucky I do not fire you this minute oh you be lucky that I do not just quit because then what would you do go on home I will see you monday can I at least have my dress back sure it be of no use to I anyway here I do not mean this one you touch this dress you will never set foot in here again sometimes the most important thing to know be when to get out and when to give in so I I would say this be a success make I realize what a bust all my other opening be well I be go to let you bask in your glory because serena be here and and she bring blair again that be the second time that girl be here today you be not I be not what oh no oh no no no no no no I be not no I mean serena

anything he fall in love with you while you be roofie how romantic no no no it be not like that he say I be completely lucid it must 've be before Georgina drug I I just do not happen to remember it believe I I have to learn the hard way Trust be the most important thing in a relationship and we have that the way I trust Nate and he trust I even though he may as well be go to school in Guam next year I would not worry if I can not find he because I know he will always be true to I I hope so b because no offense but we both know that that have not always be the case what be you say that Nate be in love with you what be you say that Gabriel be not no I be just say he be not go to break up with Poppy why would he he be have her cake and eat yours too ok right so both Nate and Chuck be obsess with you but my boyfriend can not stay faithful to I for seven day no that be I love you I just do not want to see you get hurt okay go put that back on it be beautiful on you oh Vanessa I

mark your territory so badly Nathaniel maybe you should just pee on her I do not want you to go near she again I mean that it be Blair I think I will take this one outside I think if I prove the North Caro liar be cheat with his ex that would be it but she fall for his business meeting excuse Monkey business more likely with Serena and Poppy both fight over the banana I be really worried Chuck you know how Serena be she get in over her head we need to expose this two timer for what he be so what do you say Bass one last mission by any chance do you have Poppy Lifton 's phone number queen of heart or queen of heartache Careful b cut off the head of one love triangle one of your own may grow back in its place and that conclude our co op business at this time and now the real reason you

be Netflix night with Nate or battle a beast with Bass the government the isp and the big company need to use these satellite we could be the only game in town and it have a charitable component too free wireless access for all local school and community group well this be just the sort of thing that some of we at Bass have be push for do well by do good yes but the only thing be there be a tick clock some of the major internet corporation be push to do a similar thing if we act now we block they completely and we make at least triple our investment ok Gabriel why do not you send a prospectus

approval you be golden Serena I need to see you in your room another tour he be lie to you seriously you two enough he tell Chuck that he meet you at Butter but I know for a fact that Butter be close that night because I use their bartender for the Nelly Yuki SAT sabotage party not that I need to explain this to either of you but I be with Georgina that night and she know the manager so it be probably a private party or he just misremember well Chuck also see he make a secretive phone call oh wow lady and gentleman of the jury the smoking gun a secretive phone call Blair I support you in all of your crazy choice case in point why can not you show I the same respect Gabriel be a good guy he be trustworthy even my mom trust he or she would not have invest in his project just now just face it you two you be use this as an excuse to get together again I be go back to my boyfriend now if you know what be good for you you will go back to yours Butter really it do sound kinda stupid when you say it out loud there be only one person who know what really happen that night Gabriel supposedly meet Serena wow I be not go to Yale I be so sorry I let it out like that but maybe this way it will be a little easy on Rufus have to tell you would have kill he yeah I know you do not blame he do you I blame the financial aid office and the recession and a certain imbecile former president my dad have get to be the only person in the world who be more upset about this news than I he be so excited about sell the gallery and move on do you think he will still propose he be get a lot of pride I will write you a check right now I look forward to work with you Gabriel absolutely Gabriel can I speak to you for a moment yeah of course excuse I I would like to invest as well and as much

kid we be off to see the Wicked Witch of the Upper East Side Mr Bass visit hour have start I can not believe I have to see my sworn enemy with Nancy Pelosi hair now that you mention it maybe it be good if I go in alone what you just say it you be enemy why would she help you because I be go to threaten to send she back to boot camp if she do not Blair Georgina and I go way back we have a special bond I will handle this one you do not even need I here you just want to get I alone away from Nate away from our first night in our apartment and his motive be pure of course I be sure it be a simple coincidence that he ask you to move in right when you and I begin speak again he ask I so I would not have to take the subway next year that be maybe why he get the lease on the place but ask you to move in be for my benefit ask he yourself or you could just trust he still the fact remain you choose to spend a night in a car with I over a night in your honeymoon suite with Nate but then again we all know your weakness for limos I come here for my good friend be that the only reason what be this place welcome be you a wayward soul in serching of direction I think I be in the wrong place Chuck Bass have you be save too Blair be so wrong about you what do you mean I do not want to make you feel bad but she and Chuck have this weird vendetta against you some nonsense about Butter be close that night that be ridiculous if she would have hear Savannah 's terrible southern accent that night she would have a vendetta against you instead of I so what have you think of Georgina anyway she do not make that much of impression not even her hair that flame red I mean I swear her colorist be masochistic I mean of course I remember that but who care if you have meet you that night you would forget everything else too I should uh I should go home before my mom wake up it be a 7 day session all about forgiveness and at the end of it we put on a passion play you be more than welcome to come with I I have to supervise the kid make paper mashall puzzle for the set it be brilliant oh it be not that hard it be just sd flour and paste get these Jesus freak to believe you be one of they so you do not have to go back to boot camp still the same old Chuck why can not you believe that people can change oh people can change but you you be wrong Chuck you know as bad as boot camp be it really give I time to think about the person I would become scheme manipulative it sicken I so one day I decide to do something about it I go to church find Jesus and I tell he all my sin well I bet that be a long talk he forgive I look I know it seem crazy but for the first time in my life I be I be happy but if I know Chuck Bass you be not here to be reform I come to ask if you know a man name Gabriel Edwards I do not think so why he claim he meet you at Butter that night you roofie Serena Ooh yeah I 've be pray overtime for that one but that be impossible we never go to Butter

Blair be right about Gabriel he be lie about meet I that night I do not know why yeah I know look hang tight Blair and I will be there as soon as we can okay actually since my limo 's go that might be a while and eventually a queen realize that a dark prince only have one thing on his mind and it be not slay dragon so she take her pumpkin carriage and go back to the castle with all these investment from the party we should have everything we need by the end of the month you know I think we be screw when Chuck Bass call I but you find a way to make it work and when you choose be poor and be with Serena she leave I a message she be awfully needy be not she hey Gabriel it be I listen I be come back to your hotel we have to talk do not go anywhere I will see you soon she sound nervous yeah she

a personal connection and I refuse to believe the student at our school be any bad than those at horace mann or spence so gossip girl most likely go to or go to constance yeah exactly why else the focus well I would also assume that she be our age the blast all start when we be in the ninth grade an upperclassman simply would not care so you be say gossip girl be a senior like we well if she be a senior then then that mean she be in the room right now so who could it be Rebecca sherman no her head be always in a book she be not pay enough attention okay not she either then I submit nelly

diverge I be willing to take that chance I guess now we see if Serena 's willing to bet against you I be think a personal appeal woman to woman I like what I see today seem like the right property at the right time you have the cash you should 've sign at the site be move forward by now there be just a few thing I need to figure out first like the building 's resident they be not your concern and if you want the write off for ' 09 you need to be break ground by the new year so Ho ho homeless no disrespect but I do not need your advice I 've be do pretty well without you oh yeah the empire Nice

would never send you here he know that I would not agree with this he be skeptical it be true but he do not know that I have this where have you get that the more relevant question be what your stepfather will say when he find out your mother be a cheat whore your mother and father alone in his hotel room what do you think they be do I do not know the letter do not say Knowing Lily I think we can assume the bad I be pretty sure Rufus will okay then you think about my offer honestly with this letter I could 've force you out of the picture altogether but it be not what Tripp want so I be

lover yes they use that word I be a little down at my mom 's place Man I be sorry you know they say to take thing more slowly with a friend than with someone you meet I will send it to you you might want to read it before you start this thing with Serena look like my advice go the way of the clog what be you talk about the clog an ugly wooden shoe that try to make a statement then disappear just like your resolve to take thing slow with Nate I be just go to go with it you know whatever happen happen Knowing Serena what will probably happen be she will get sweep up in the romance and she be not go to want to talk about any of that stuff ever really Nah look it be cool I 've know Serena since I be a little kid and we 've already you know year ago I know trust I now I can see that Nate and I be only perfect on paper but you and Nate can finally be more than just an affair to remember which be why we do not want to wait for it to start and why you do not want to scare he off the point be I 've date serena for over a year and if you want to be able to make thing work you'llhave to be able to come up for air which be not her favorite thing to do you be the one thing Nate have always want and could never have it be like a diet after year of starvation you can not let he gorge on sundaes he will panic and decide he hate ice cream except I be not ice cream and Nate and I do not need to play game everyone need to play game you 've already fail to come out of the gate with any restraint or control now all you can do be introduce some competition make he work for it Blair that be the bad advice I 've ever hear wait till he start pass on dessert so the ambassador 's daughter 's go to be at this dinner yeah but her father 's get she under 24 hour surveillance which mean her guard will be on she at all time I can meet she in the lady ' room I bet they do not follow she in there or we could switch handbag you need to know this be a state dinner so there be security everywhere all bag will be search the problem be not get the package to Violette it be get the package in in the first place I could wear it I can make this only in mine the paillette will not be empty you put the pill in the jacket yeah I wear it to the dinner check it and then Violette and I switch coat check tag I take her coat and she will leave with yours it be not bad not bad come on it be brilliant what be you do in Brooklyn I hope your father would be here he be suppose to be back this morning I can not imagine he would come here first well I just figure since he have not see you over the holiday you know how sentimental he be yeah Dad well you know what maybe he decide to stay and ski another day yeah I do not think that be what happen I should go if you see he tell he I stop by okay Vronsky where be you Anna Karenina texte you an hour ago she want to celebrate sorry but Anna will have to wait I be about to walk into a meeting with monsieur duris be you bring he here to surprise I as it turn out I be not able to attend the lunch be you in the hospital since I know that you be alive there could be no other possible reason you would sacrifice my future I will get you your introduction okay Monsieur Duris will be attend the dinner for the french ambassador oh thank god you nearly give I a heart attack why do not you mention this early I just assume you would rather not cross path with Carla Bruni in time of crisis sacrifice must be make why do you miss lunch Iwant to meet someone whose schedule be even more unpredictable than mine I will see you tonight I 've be wait here for four hour have Elizabeth Fisher still not return she do return mr Bass then why do she not get my message that I be wait for she in the bar she do she check out of the hotel immediately afterwards it be Anna Karenina you never read it do not worry about it I never do what be you do here make a decision how be you do do you end up go away I get back this morning and be you back for good that be what I be decide I come over to talk to Lily but now I be not sure I want to give she a chance to explain but still there be a part of I that do not want to know Cup of coffee it be freeze out here Coffee actually sound really good okay thank you thank you I be just about to call you well now you do not have to or we do not have to talk at all look I I be just think that maybe it might make sense if I go to that dinner alone I do not understand do I do something wrong no no not at all I just you know we say we do not want to rush into thing yeah but that be before we see each other I know but I be just try to stick to the plan here okay so the plan go from have sex on eleanor waldorf 's floor to not see each other just because we lose track for a minute there do not mean we should forget about it I mean we already see each other today we can wait a couple more day right you be right Nate the last thing I want to do be rush into something Serena come on hello hey Damien Serena do not tell I you need help with your spanish homework no french this time please tell I you do not have a date to the ambassador 's dinner be you ask I if I want to go with you of course I do Great I be stay at the Waldorfs ' so I will text you the address I will see you tomorrow Heure hora laat no matter what language you say it in look like S just start the clock on a tick time bomb I think you would be at school by now I think you live in the Upper East Side with your wife Lily come by yesterday look for you what be go on we have a fight it be complicated israeli Palestinian complicate by the look of it be this why you ship Jenny and I off to mom 's for christmas this be her year and it be not one of those parent trap situation that you and Jenny could swoop in on we need time to figure this out and you be do that by not tell she where you be it be not the good strategy but until I talk to she at least I can hold out hope that I be wrong about what happen so you be not talk to she because you do not want to hear what you think she might tell you you know I be not willing to explain myself Dan all right fine fine you can make your own damn waffle come on Dan listen you be the one who be always say to be honest and talk about thing so I really hope you be not go to let your marriage die because you be scared to take your own advice Ta Da all the girl be go to want to wear pharmaceutical it be perfect I be impressed thank I be really excited about tonight yeah yeah I too unfortunately we be go to have to do our little dinner some other time what I think we be do this together it be my plan yeah I know and I thank you it be just that anyone can check the jacket I be go with someone else Serena actually we be old friend from boarding school Serena 's with nate now I do not know about that she be the one who call and ask I so you know she be change since boarding school and there be no way she be go to go to a state dinner wear a jacket fill with pill I probably will not tell she about that then well then maybe I will see if you be to do that then I would have to tell she how you know obviously so anyway do not worry you will still get your cut what be go on why be not you dress look Blair I be sorry but I will not be able to join you for dîn ce soir abandon I in a fur hat be one thing but you can not do this you already miss the lunch you know my dream be dead without a proper introduction to Mr Duris I leave word with his people that you would be there okay I be sure you will find a way to make an impression this be about she be not it the floozy from your father 's grave you say you have no interest in find it appear I may have speak too quickly in that regard first you lie to I and now you sacrifice my table élitaire charter to go look for some random woman you obviously read the file so you know she be not random she know my mother 's favorite flower she have a picture of my father in her jewelry and she know I and clearly have no interest in be find by you you 've be look for week and nothing one dinner will not make a difference you may find this hard to comprehend but some thing be more important than your social Climbing agenda his name 's Damien he be the son of the belgian ambassador and I be pretty sure they hook up at boarding school I be guess Serena do not tell you she be come with he huh no no she do not why be you here I figure you 've come to my rescue enough time let I help you for once hi may I take your coat you come with he you come with her I think you be at the wrong place Prom be down the street oh that be fine I will just let you get back to your euro fawn what be you do here what I start Serena I love your jacket it be so beautiful yeah let I help you with that no it be okay I be go to keep it on it be so pretty and it be a gift from you so sweet of you come on so much for diplomacy let the international game begin Serena and not Nate hi I be Blair Damien a pleasure the french ambassador 's daughter be an old friend of mine I be go to let you guy excuse I I see you take my advice it be good to keep Nate on his toe and nice choice of competition thank you your idea 's completely juvenile but it seem to be work I be Jenny Nice to meet you thank you so much I can not believe he come with Jenny if I know Jenny she come with he but trust I this be exactly what you want Games will be play sexual innuendo ensue and in the end Nate will be right where you want he my problem be not nearly so easily resolve even monsieur Duris ' entourage be perfection in bone structure and styling while without a formal introduction I have no choice but to stalk he Blair you know you do not need Chuck anyone can see you be an elitist snob who be perfect to run a secret society Bonne chance ah Merci on a un petit souci mais je t'assure que tu l'auras au prix demandé à la fin de la soirée Tu as intérêt sinon j'appellerai le flic pour cette garce qui le porte hi I be Jenny french people really be rude she be usually a much happy customer look like the plan be off the rail from what I recall from boarding school it be not difficult to get Serena out of her clothe that jacket be not leave this party on Serena Van Der Woodsen I do not know why you be here with he I mean if you be try to make I jealous there be no reason to I want to be here with you I invite you but then you uninvite I but you be right take it slow be the right decision hi Damien Nate Archibald Serena let I introduce you to some people thank for keep my date company so what be the deal with Nate he seem like he want to cut my head off be he an ex boyfriend oh possibly a new one honestly that be the reason I ask you to bring I here tonight I be sorry no do not be the old make he jealous by bring the title european ploy Yep I be flatter you think I be worthy of the task thank you for understand if you really want to make he jealous though I suggest we commit fully you know let I take off this jacket no Damien I be sorry I can not do this this be a huge mistake already I no no no we can make it well no string attach Damien I do not like you like that I mean it be you serious what happen to the Serena that I want throughout boarding school I 've change and it be a good thing I be sorry that be not Monsieur Duris C'est vous n'est ce pas I be sorry have we be introduce I be Blair Waldorf perhaps you 've hear of I I submit a charter application for N Y U can you just hold on one minute do not go anywhere I will be right back Chuck there you be I know you would see the error of your way Monsieur Duris just step out to smoke which give we two and a half minute maybe four I come to apologize what happen do not tell I that awful whore do something terrible to you I think that whore may be my mother there you be Serena 's about to leave you need to stop she you know what Jenny this just be not fun for I anymore I should have never listen to Dan okay I do not know what Dan say but why would you take romantic advice from a guy who have a Cabbage Patch doll I do not know all you need to know be I blow my chance the masquerade ball be two year ago do not let Serena get away again you know your mother die during childbirth what if she do not what if it be just another of my father 's many lie look it make sense that when you finally let your father go your mother would reappear she be not a ghost Blair do not you think I know how crazy this sound it be why I could not tell you or anyone I be aware that one of Bart 's old girlfriend may have know my name and maybe even look like old picture of my mother but my father only have one of these make with an e on it this woman have it whoever she be it just seem like she will make lose your mom hurt all over again do you really think anything could be more painful than kill my own mother and have my father hate I for it my whole life if there be any chance this be not what happen I have to know I do not want to keep you from your business with monsieur Duris I just have to let you know nothing be more important than be with you for this sometimes despite the risk the only thing to do be seize the moment or whatever else you can grab I really always hope that Blair be wrong about these thing but if you want to be with I because I be with someone else you can forget it I want to be with you I get scared that if we move too fast thing be not go to work out and I really do not want that to happen okay because I 've wait I 've wait a really long time for this I too we need to talk Rufus finally I must have call you a hundred time I tell you I would call you back when I be ready I guess I just do not expect it to take quite so long well I guess you should have think about that before you spend the night in a hotel room with your ex husband well I be here now so why do not you tell I exactly what happen Lil I be not interested in any more lie we should probably go let us finish what we start not have any fun no no but you go ahead and have yours please gloat you 've earn it you be always tell I that this be a business and not my social life but yet you be the one who screw up a major deal 'cause you want to fulfill a high school dream of a night with Serena Van Der Woodsen Irony duly note maybe next time you will not be so quick to dismiss I I do not know if there will be a next time word of this botched job will get around to my client and I owe Violette more money than I could steal back from my father so it be time for I to head back to the continent why be that jacket on the floor it belong to the ambassador 's daughter she will be furious hang it up and make sure that Violette get it when she leave look like you can cancel that transatlantic ticket I guess so Elizabeth I be sorry have we meet you run away from I at my father 's grave Charles Bass oh of course I apologize for my sudden departure it be a very emotional day you must have know my father well I be not sure what give you that impression your father and I simply share a few memorable month many year ago I be actually visit my mother 's grave and I just stop to pay my respect at that time of the night on the anniversary of my father 's death I see you have his favorite flower and you know who I be I be sorry I read that Bart have a son and you look just like your father Most people say I more closely resemble my mother I would not know I never have the pleasure of meet she well maybe you can tell I why you have her locket your father give it to I the e be for Elizabeth I love to believe it be a special gift I be fairly certain he give it to all his girlfriend at the time you can keep it if you would like I be sure it mean a great deal more to you than it do to I I be sorry I can not help you find whatever it be you be look for Blair I be sorry to waste your time you should have stay with monsieur Duris I would not want to be anywhere else I be just go to visit the lady ' room then we will leave I will bring the car around Elizabeth I already tell your friend everything I know and he may have buy it but I originate that innocent doe eyed stare I usually employ it when I know more than I be willing to let on Chuck spend his entire life believe that he kill his mother if you know anything that could take away even a second of that pain it would be cruel not to share it otherwise leave town mean never have to say you be sorry could there be a secret even b can not crack only time will tell I be exhaust I be scared I think my mother be go to die he be a doctor he know people that could help she I have to seek he out I already know about Cece be sick and I know that she get well I be not go to sit here for another hour while you talk around this thing what do you want I to tell you tell I that you be not with he while I be take care of our kid tell I that you do not sleep with your ex husband I do not sleep with he I do kiss he but that be all it must have be one hell of a kiss for you to build all these lie look I promise it do not mean anything we be engage it mean something to I where be you go I need time to figure this out away from you

absolutely you never make it to my lacrosse game yesterday what be you do I could ask you the same do Serena know you be try to pull off plaid seriously I expect Chuck to go back to his old habit after your breakup but I would actually think you would grow up a little whatever do you mean Blair Waldorf on the upper West Side two day in a row it look like you be pretend to be a Columbia student and not that I care much about what Jenny Humphrey do these day but I see that smackdown on Gossip Girl she be deal drug it be call an intervention it be call you go back to plot and connive okay and that be the Waldorf equivalent of Chuck go around sleep with every call girl in the city and avoid any kind of emotional contact okay so I be pretend to be a student here but it be because I be live a nightmare I be trap at N Y U and it be too late to transfer so what be wrong with cheer myself up with a little denial and a Gossip Girl blast or two nothing I guess but you can always make it right with whoever you take down online and who know if Chuck 's even go to have time to do that with Lily or not Morning sunshine I 've get the Dom 95 your favorite no thank you and I much prefer Roederer nowadays oh I apologize Nadine leave behind some of her intimate she must have want an excuse to come back or maybe she just leave in a hurry if you be here to mock I I be not in the mood unless you
