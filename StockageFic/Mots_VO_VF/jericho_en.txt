come to this I want you to know this have nothing to do with you personnally I be sure you be wonderfull but let us be honest here you be the one that lay the few egg and I distinctly tell all of you that this be go to happen I believe I make myself perfectly clear in that regard all right the thing be if you know I at all you would see how really funny this be because this be so not my thing no this be Stanley 's thing it be just I be awfully hungry and I do not want to get into the whole circle of life business but I just can not eat anymore sprout ok enough stall here we go here be my concern I 've hear story about how you be go to react to this and if I see half of you run around well I just know I be go to freak out so if you could do your good to minimize that part of it I would just really appreciate it sprout it be you really out here look for deer Thought they be all go what do you want Harry do you think you could come into city hall today grays still out and itd be nice to have somebody around who know what they be do not my job anymore and get lose I be try to shoot some deer just be for a day or two you be start to look an awful lot like a deer Harry I 've be in the FBI for 15 year I work law enforcement after college and then I join the bureau where do you go to school Georgetown you wanna see my ring the FBI what be you work on I be send here to monitor the phone call make in the area to a suspect terrorist cell and what do you find out Nothing Trail go dead we about do here not even close tell I about her Sarah Mason she be go you be pretty thorough also take care of the one in the cabinet and the one behind the water heater there be only one load gun in this house and it be mine sit down arm behind you tell I about Sarah Jimmy say she be also a cop in St Louis she be work with you against you who be these people you be make a serious mistake I be a Federal Officer really really sure you be not Robert Willer State Department how about Robert Snyder Colombus PD Commander Robert Richmond Naval Intelligence none of those be real and neither be that badge who the hell be you who do you you work for you do not wanna know what I know I think I can handle it really Cause I can barely handle it and I be train for this you want to tell I or you tell the whole town all right but once you hear this you be a part of it Jake and there be no go back who do you work for CIA Sarah Mason and I be part of an off the book team we be track the bomb use in the attack where do they come from the bomb the US government bring they in see after the Soviet Union fall neglect military in the satellite republic start sell their nuclear stockpile on the black market so the CIA start an operation get that material by any and all mean necessary but a few year ago a shipment disappear on its way to the DOE storage complex in Oak Ridge and that be where my CIA team come in why you I be the good at what I do and what be that Satellite installation I have a 2 o'clock appointment with Mr Higgins I 've be inside all day how be the weather out there you know it look like rain thank you hello Victor Hawkins I believe you know everyone here except this young lady Robert Hawkins Sarah Mason all right let us get down to it we have a lot of ground to cover as most of you know a shipment of nuke from project Red Bell be miss what you do not know be that we have quality intel that those warhead have be convert into 25 small high yield device these bomb have be dissiminate to extremist cell active within the United States so be this Al Qaeda I wish it be that simple it be much large than that it be a cross section of domestic militia anarchist and religious fanatic as you can see these be terrorist that would never collaborate ideologically or politically the only thing that link they be the desire to take down the federal government our job be to get undercover in these cell and find these bomb so who do we think be orchestrate this the agency 's be at this from every angle and all we know be that he be get deep ressource an ability to coordinate diverse group and by all indication he be an American we be break up into group of two each unit be assign a terrorist cell one agent go undercover one act as a handler you can not expect I to believe you be send here undercover what be so special about this place you know I would show you but that be clever it be over there behind the map where do you get this those be defense department projection they 've be do since the 50 the fallout scenario in the event of a nuclear attack on 20 US city and you see Jericho it be outside the fallout zone Jake it be get a salt mine plenty of farm land and access to an untainted water table so you be not here to monitor phone call Jericho be a rally point in case we fail in our mission fail or succeed and Johnston be he want to come I know he do he be just have a hard time deal with thing lately he always get quiet when he be go through something but just wish I could think of something to help he get through this we miss you sweetheart there be no more sprout you finish they I be hungry what be you do here Sean it be like 9 30 in the morning oh my you sleep here well actually there be not a lot of sleep go on get out of the house what be you do you let he spend a night yes well that do not seem like something Stanley would approve of do it Stanley 's not here just like that you infiltrate a terror cell plan a nuclear attack yeah just like that it take I 2 year 8 month of it in prison develop contact get into the network the only outside person I communicate with be my handler after prison I spend another year try to gain their trust on the outside and even then I be only scratch the surface but you get in how they be look for high grade government id you give they their badge I have to proove that I be loyal and valuable to the cell Jake I think I 've hear enough no you barely scratch the surface you be the one who want to hear this so why do not you hear it all the cell be look for id and I need to get high up in their organisation so I let it be know that I have a source see the badge be go to be tag so that my team could track they they send I to make the buy with another cell member it be a kid name Daryl how do we know these be real they be real enough where do you get they from how and where I get these badge be my business what you do with they be yours nice do business with you you too we should celebrate man go out get some girl except you do not really seem like the type all serious be you marry I be really what happen what the hell be go on hold it right there I be sorry man you got to be kid I FBI Hands in the air back against the car it turn out Daryl be an FBI informant but my handler get I out and we keep my cover intact so the FBI have an informant in my target cell and they can not tell we anything about that you know I be damn lucky that my cover be not blow your cover 's intact yes yeah we believe so then let us move on have you be able to make contact with those coordinate the attack no but at this stage I recommend that we take down the cell that we 've already inflitrate you know at the very least that would disrupt the overall plan maybe delay it for how many of the bomb can you get a third for sure half if we be lucky look I know it be not ideal but at this stage it be the safe move that be still a dozen bomb in play what be you do I just think there be a way to speed this up and get all the bomb at once yeah and we agree that do you mind I think there may be a way to get we far inside my partner tell the cell leader that Daryl be the FBI informant that give he the credibility that he need to move up fast then let we handle the FBI and do whatever be necessary to save the operation it be all go to take some time but we be close ok we be count on you and you know the risk you would well be right about this this be the right way to go trust I what would you have do Stayed in or pull the plug it seem like the wrong question to I I would ask myself how much I trust my partner well if I can sneak up here without you so much as turn around how be you go to hear any game I hear you half a mile back in those shoe you say you would come with I to see April today fine you come home for dinner there be no deer in these wood they 've all be pick clean then I guess I will be here a while I never want to be a mom ' I do not sign up for this you know what you be right I owe it to Stanley so I be just go to have to jump in with both foot whether she want to hear from I or not listen to I go on about my own problem you must be ady to take this hatchet and do the damn job yourself I do not know that he know how to sign what do he say to you never mind look that boy 's bad news now I can not stop you from see he but he be no long welcome in this house do you understand I Allison so why do you feel like you can not hang out at

not want to hang out with they either what about now they be go there be this thing that go down at my house a couple week ago I do something ok what do you do I do something that can not be forgive now my mom just keep look at I like I 've change into some kind of monster or something you know you have not right so even though you be not sure about the plan you out the informant to the cell leader once we decide to leave the bomb in play it be the only way for I to get deep enough into the cell and gain their trust I tell the cell leader that Daryl be the informant but I want to get he out of there before they kill he come on grab what you need and let us go they be go to hunt I down and they be go to kill I it be your lucky day Daryl they be go to get you into witness protection so do not worry we be go to get you out of here stay there damn it what be it Daryl we just wanna talk the cell leader you got to get I out of this place run I will tell they that you get away I think my leg be break please help I or I be go to tell they who you really be I be sorry so I finally gain their trust I be in you kill he it be either kill he or possibly let million of people die they die

heater there be only one load gun in this house and it be mine sit down arm behind you tell I about Sarah Jimmy say she be also a cop in St Louis she be work with you against you who be these people

this you want to tell I or you tell the whole town all right but once you hear this you be a part of it Jake and there be no go back who do you work for CIA Sarah Mason and I be part of an off the book team we be track the bomb use in the attack where do they come from the bomb the US government bring they in see after the Soviet Union fall neglect military in the satellite republic start sell their nuclear stockpile on the black market so the CIA start an operation get that material by any and all mean necessary but a few year ago a shipment disappear on its way to the DOE storage complex in Oak Ridge and that be where my CIA team come in why you I be the good at what I do and what be that Satellite installation I have a 2 o'clock appointment with Mr Higgins I 've be inside all day how be the weather out there you know it look like rain thank you hello Victor Hawkins I believe you know everyone here except this young lady Robert Hawkins Sarah Mason all right let us get down to it we have a lot of ground to cover as most of you know a shipment of nuke from project Red Bell be miss what you do not know be that we have quality intel that those warhead have be convert into 25 small high yield device these bomb have be dissiminate to extremist cell active within the United States so be this Al Qaeda I wish it be that simple it be much large than that it be a cross section of domestic militia anarchist and religious fanatic as you can see these be terrorist that would never collaborate ideologically or politically the only thing that link they be the desire to take down the federal government our job be to get undercover in these cell and find these bomb so who do we think be orchestrate this the agency 's be at this from every angle and all we know be that he be get deep ressource an ability to coordinate diverse group and by all indication he be an American we be break up into group of two each unit be assign a terrorist cell one agent go undercover one act as a handler you can not expect I to believe you be send here undercover what be so special about this place you know I would show you but that be clever it be over there behind the map where do you get this those be defense department projection they 've be do since the 50 the fallout scenario in the event of a nuclear attack on 20 US city and you see Jericho it be outside the fallout zone Jake it be get a salt mine plenty of farm land and access to an untainted water table so you be not here to monitor phone call Jericho be a rally point in case we fail in our mission fail or succeed and Johnston be he want to come I know he do he be just have a hard time deal with thing lately he always get quiet when he be go through something but just wish I could think of something to help he get through this we miss you sweetheart there be no more sprout you finish they I be hungry what be you do here Sean it be like 9 30 in the morning oh my you sleep here well actually there be not a lot of sleep go on get out of the house what be you do you let he spend a night yes well that do not seem like something Stanley would approve of do it Stanley 's not here just like that you infiltrate a terror cell plan a nuclear attack yeah just like that it take I 2 year 8 month of it in prison develop contact get into the network the only outside person I communicate with be my handler after prison I spend another year try to gain their trust on the outside and even then I be only scratch the surface but you get in how they be look for high grade government id you give they their badge I have to proove that I be loyal and valuable to the cell Jake I think I 've hear enough no you barely scratch the surface you be the one who want to hear this so why do not you hear it all the cell be look for id and I need to get high up in their organisation so I let it be know that I have a source see the badge be go to be tag so that my team could track they they send I to make the buy with another cell member it be a kid name Daryl how do we know these be real they be real enough where do you get they from how and where I get these badge be my business what you do with they be yours nice do business with you you too we should celebrate man go out get some girl except you do not really seem like the type all serious be you marry I be really what happen what the hell be go on hold it right there I be sorry man you got to be kid I FBI Hands in the air back against the car it turn out Daryl be an FBI informant but my handler get I out and we keep my cover intact so the FBI have an informant in my target cell and they can not tell we anything about that you know I be damn lucky that my cover be not blow your cover 's intact yes yeah we believe so then let us move on have you be able to make contact with those coordinate the attack no but at this stage I recommend that we take down the cell that we 've already inflitrate you know at the very least that would disrupt the overall plan maybe delay it for how many of the bomb can you get a third for sure half if we be lucky look I know it be not ideal but at this stage it be the safe move that be still a dozen bomb in play what be you do I just think there be a way to speed this up and get all the bomb at once yeah and we agree that do you mind I think there may be a way to get we far inside my partner tell the cell leader that Daryl be the FBI informant that give he the credibility that he need to move up fast then let we handle the FBI and do whatever be necessary to save the operation it be all go to take some time but we be close ok we be count on you and you know the risk you would well be right about this this be the right way to go trust I what would you have do Stayed in or pull the plug it seem like the wrong question to I I would ask myself how much I trust my partner well if I can sneak up here without you so much as turn around how be you go to hear any game I hear you half a mile back in those shoe you say you would come with I to see April today fine you come home for dinner there be no deer in these wood they 've all be pick clean then I guess I will be here a while I never want to be a mom ' I do not sign up for this you know what you be right I owe it to Stanley so I be just go to have to jump in with both foot whether she want to hear from I or not listen to I go on about my own problem you must be ady to take this hatchet and do the damn job yourself I do not know that he know how to sign what do he say to you never mind look that boy 's bad news now I can not stop you

this thing that go down at my house a couple week ago I do something ok what do you do I do something that can not be forgive now my mom just keep look at I like I 've change into some kind of monster or something you know you have not right so even though you be not sure about the plan you out the informant to the cell leader once we decide to leave the bomb in play it be the only way for I to get deep enough into the cell and gain their trust I tell the cell leader that Daryl be the informant but I want to get he out of there before they kill he come on grab what you need and let us go they be go to hunt I down and they be go to kill I it be your lucky day Daryl they be go to get you into witness protection so do not worry we be go to get you out of here stay there damn it what be it Daryl we just wanna talk the cell leader you got to get I out of this place run I will tell they that you get away I think my leg be break please help I or I be go to tell they who you really be I be sorry so I finally gain their trust I be in you kill he it be either kill he or possibly let million of people die they die anyway Jake you be still down there call he off you be not help your cause by keep

regard all right the thing be if you know I at all you would see how really funny this be because this be so not my thing no this be Stanley 's thing it be just I be awfully hungry and I do not want to get into the whole circle of life business but I just can not eat anymore sprout ok enough stall here we go here be my concern I 've hear story about how you be go to react to this and if I see

Thought they be all go what do you want Harry do you think you could come into city hall today grays still out and itd be nice to have somebody around who know what they be do not my job anymore and get lose I be try to shoot some deer just be for a day or two you be start to look an awful lot like a deer Harry I 've be in the FBI for 15 year I work law enforcement after college and then I join the bureau where do you go to school Georgetown you wanna see my ring the FBI what be you work on I be send here to monitor the phone call make in the area to a suspect terrorist cell and what do you find out Nothing Trail go dead we about do here not even close tell I about her Sarah Mason she be go you be pretty thorough also take care of the one in the cabinet and the one behind the water heater there be only one load gun in this house and it be mine sit down arm behind you tell I about Sarah Jimmy say she be also a cop in St Louis she be work with you against you who be these people you be make a serious mistake I be a Federal Officer really really sure you be not Robert Willer State Department how about Robert Snyder Colombus PD Commander Robert Richmond Naval Intelligence none of those be real and neither be that badge who the hell be you who do you you work for you do not wanna know what I know I think I can handle it really Cause I can barely handle it and I be train for this you want to tell I or you tell the whole town all right but once you hear this you be a part of it Jake and there be no go back who do you work for CIA Sarah Mason and I be part of an off the book team we be track the bomb use in the attack where do they come from the bomb the US government bring they in see after the Soviet Union fall neglect military in the satellite republic start sell their nuclear stockpile on the black market so the CIA start an operation get that material by any and all mean necessary but a few year ago a shipment disappear on its way to the DOE storage complex in Oak Ridge and that be where my CIA team come in why you I be the good at what I do and what be that Satellite installation I have a 2 o'clock appointment with Mr Higgins I 've be inside all day how be the weather out there you know it look like rain thank you hello Victor Hawkins I believe you know everyone here except this young lady Robert Hawkins Sarah Mason all right let us get down to it we have a lot of ground to cover as most of you know a shipment of nuke from project Red Bell be miss what you do not know be that we have quality intel that those warhead have be convert into 25 small high yield device these bomb have be dissiminate to extremist cell active within the United States so be this Al Qaeda I wish it be that simple it be much large than that it be a cross section of domestic militia anarchist and religious fanatic as you can see these be terrorist that would never collaborate ideologically or politically the only thing that link they be the desire to take down the federal government our job be to get undercover in these cell and find these bomb so who do we think be orchestrate this the agency 's be at this from every angle and all we know be that he be get deep ressource an ability to coordinate diverse group and by all indication he be an American we be break up into group of two each unit be assign a terrorist cell one agent go undercover one act as a handler you can not expect I to believe you be send here undercover what be so special about this place you know I would show you but that be clever it be over there behind the map where do you get this those be defense department projection they 've be do since the 50 the fallout scenario in the event of a nuclear attack on 20 US city and you see Jericho it be outside the fallout zone Jake it be get a salt mine plenty of farm land and access to an untainted water table so you be not here to monitor phone call Jericho be a rally point in case we fail in our mission fail or succeed and Johnston be he want to come I know he do he be just have a hard time deal with thing lately he always get quiet when he be go through something but just wish I could think of something to help he get through this we miss you sweetheart there be no more sprout you finish they I be hungry what be you do here Sean it be like 9 30 in the morning oh my you sleep here well actually there be not a lot of sleep go on get out of the house what be you do you let he spend a night yes well that do not seem like something Stanley would approve of do it Stanley 's not here just like that you infiltrate a terror cell plan a nuclear attack yeah just like that it take I 2 year 8 month of it in prison develop contact get into the network the only outside person I communicate with be my handler after prison I spend another year try to gain their trust on the outside and even then I be only scratch the surface but you get in how they be look for high grade government id you give they their badge I have to proove that I be loyal and valuable to the cell Jake I think I 've hear enough no you barely scratch the surface you be the one who want to hear this so why do not you hear it all the cell be look for id and I need to get high up in their organisation so I let it be know that I have a source see the badge be go to be tag so that my team could track they they send I to make the buy with another cell member it be a kid name Daryl how do we know these be real they be real enough where do you get they from how and where I get these badge be my business what you do with they be yours nice do business with you you too we should celebrate man go out get some girl except you do not really seem like the type all serious be you marry I be really what happen what the hell be go on hold it right there I be sorry man you got to be kid I FBI Hands in the air back against the car it turn out Daryl be an FBI informant but my handler get I out and we keep my cover intact so the FBI have an informant in my target cell and they can not tell we anything about that you know I be damn lucky that my cover be not blow your cover 's intact yes yeah we believe so then let us move on have you be able to make contact with those coordinate the attack no but at this stage I recommend that we take down the cell that we 've already inflitrate you know at the very least that would disrupt the overall plan maybe delay it for how many of the bomb can you get a third for sure half if we be lucky look I know it be not ideal but at this stage it be the safe move that be still a dozen bomb in play what be you do I just think there be a way to speed this up and get all the bomb at once yeah and we agree that do you mind I think there may be a way to get we far inside my partner tell the cell leader that Daryl be the FBI informant that give he the credibility that he need to move up fast then let we handle the FBI and do whatever be necessary to save the operation it be all go to take some time but we be close ok we be count on you and you know the risk you would well be right about this this be the right way to go trust I what would you have do Stayed in or pull the plug it seem like the wrong question to I I would ask myself how much I trust my partner well if I can sneak up here without you so much as turn around how be you go to hear any game I hear you half a mile back in those shoe you say you would come with I to see April today fine you come home for dinner there be no deer in these wood they 've all be pick clean then I guess I will be here a while I never want to

at it Jake oh have to take a shower go ahead no I I do I just take a shower oh right so what be up I April say that the medical center be run low on gasoline for the generator and it occur to I that if we have a length of hose and a funnel we could siphon gas out of our car then it occur to I there be all that gas in the tank at Murthy 's gas station and if we could get enough suction we could get all the gas we want would a water pump do it Bonnie this could be my brother be this how they die no Stanley do not get it this bad he could still got cancer no we do not know that listen do not worry about I I will be fine take care of he I be go to have to put he on a ventilator it will use up power but but the baby have the well chance for survival save the generator for the baby hey hey hey what about he give he something for the pain keep he comfortable sit back and watch he die well I do not like it Jake but that be the most rational option we have right now unless you can think of something well will your generator last until morning I think so all right give I until then can you tell I your name Victor Miller Victor Victor you be in a medical clinic okay we be go to take care of you no no they be come they be come so how long do you think he will be unconscious could be a long time if he ever wake up again who be they who be come well maybe he see passenger from one of

be not my gas it belong to Noraco it be no use to anyone Mr Murthy without electricity the pump do not even work and we will leave you an i o u for the 500 gallon I could be fire with all due respect

be that simple it be much large than that it be a cross section of domestic militia anarchist and religious fanatic as you can see these be terrorist that would never collaborate ideologically or politically the only thing that link they be the desire to take down the federal government our job be to get undercover in these cell and find these bomb so who do we think be orchestrate this the agency 's be at this from every angle and all we know be that he be get deep ressource an ability to coordinate diverse group and by all indication he be an American we be break up into group of two each unit be assign a terrorist cell one agent go undercover one act as a handler you can not expect I to believe you be send here undercover what be so special about this place you know I would show

's intact yes yeah we believe so then let us move on have you be able to make contact with those coordinate the attack no but at this stage I recommend that we take down the cell that we 've already inflitrate you know at the very least that would disrupt the overall plan maybe delay it for how many of the bomb can you get a third for sure half if we be lucky look I know it be not ideal but at this stage it be the safe move that be still a dozen bomb in play what be you do I just think there be a way to speed this up and get all the bomb at once yeah and we agree that do you mind I think there may be a way to get we far inside my partner tell the cell leader that Daryl be the FBI informant that give he the credibility that he need to move up fast then let we handle the FBI and do whatever be necessary to save the operation it be all go to take some time but we be close ok we be count on you and you know the risk you would well be right about this this be the right way to go trust I what would you have do Stayed in or pull the plug it seem like the wrong question to I I would ask myself how much I trust my partner well if I can sneak up here without you so much as turn around how be you go to hear any game I hear you half a mile back in those shoe you say you would come with I to see April today fine you come home for dinner there be no deer in these wood they 've

now my mom just keep look at I like I 've change into some kind of monster or something you know you have not right so even though you be not sure about the plan you out the informant to the cell leader once we decide to leave the bomb in play it be the only way for I to get deep enough into the cell and gain their trust I tell the cell leader that Daryl be the informant but I want to get he out of there before they kill he come on grab what you need and let us go they be go to hunt I down and they be go to kill I it be your lucky day Daryl they be go to get you into witness protection so

in everyone 's interest to extend a blanket of amnesty over a wide range of act commit during the lawless period after the attack Constantino can not just walk away from this to be fair he be be remove from office we be not just go to let this go Jake let he explain I do not want an explanation Gray yeah well I do this guy be be help to protect we from a world that frankly have be kick our ass for the last six month Constantino be responsible for the death a chance to make his case of over 60 man and woman in this town include my father there be not go to be any reconciliation until he be dead I want you all to pay close attention to what I be about to say there will be no vigilantism in my jurisdiction there will be no revenge killing Period get the door four year ago I be task with pacify a hot spot an hour outside of Kandahar I walk into this powder keg and I do what I always do try to figure out who the guy be what guy what be you talk about Theguy there be always one I arrange a meeting big public thing in the middle of the village his guy be armed to the tooth just wait for an excuse so I walk up to he I lay my weapon down I show he I understand his place in the order of thing and you think I be your guy I want you to be Jericho 's Sheriff those people follow you on the battlefield they respect you help I do my job help these people move on think about it what would you have do if the guy if he take a shot at you just think about it what do he want do not matter gather the Rangers we will meet tonight tomorrow we be go to New Bern we be go to kill Constantino you a from HQ this be a manhunt and this be our target the suspect 's in possession of a high yield nuclear device the same sort that carry out the September attack your order be to shoot on sight we be go to find this terrorist no matter what it take thank you could you copy these and distribute they as well we okay so I get a little bit of a situation I need a safe house Jake Somewhere um off the beat path well my grandpa have a hunting cabin have not be use in year okay why what be go on you know the news be say that the September attack be back by Iran and North Korea yeah yeah I know you say it be domestic terrorism which be what it be why would the government lie about that Gee I do not know Jake you do not know I really do not know thank you we be meet at Bailey 's tonight after close if you be still around I need you there then I will be there do they not have food in Cheyenne may we have a word ma'am the New Bern man from yesterday the shooter how do you know he he be one of Constantino 's deputy when I find out what Constantino be plan to do to Jericho a deputy be tell to take I out of town and um execute you but he let you go I get lucky the deputy assign to I refuse to take those kind of order but they do not all refuse they the man you see yesterday he be one of the bad I see do you think he should die for what he do well I think there be be enough die around here lately do not you I want you to be my liaison to the people of New Bern and Jericho excuse I I need somebody with tie to both town why would I do that why would not you well Colonel Hoffman say you show a lot of gut with he he recommend you specifically I assume you would want to help I just come from a town where guy with gun in uniform make life very unpleasant and you can not tell the difference between I and Phil Constantino hi I go to take a shower before you dump I for someone less sweaty tell I you do not sign this contract I do not sign that contract thank God yeah I sign the other one that be a copy why would you do that do not you read it first yes I read it Stanley what what what have I do well first of all you owe they a share of your crop start immediately but you will not be credit the three year until you see a national monetary system be reinstate by the federal government and an exchange rate can be establish so so what if it take they year to get the economy back together you be go to just keep fork over your crop well no I give they my crop for a while and then I be out of debt right that be how you get into debt in the first place you know I be go to take a shower look wait I no you look I be not stupid we be also hear that New Bern be under complete lockdown Curfews military checkpoint all over town but but we think we find an angle they 've get Constantino work at the factory he leave there around 8 00 every night Security at that shift change be pretty light so if we hit he here right here there be a chance we will get a clean shot and get out without getting catch where be you go Home hey hey do you suddenly get a conscience hey you know if you be smart you would let three month go by wait until everything calm down and then you would go in there quietly in the middle of the night and you would kill Constantino in his sleep 'cause that I would understand but this this be you just make a big show out of it Jake and it be both dangerous and stupid really yes really I can not be a part of this he be out yeah yeah it look that way we will manage listen you do not want to hear this but you think maybe you should sit this one out come on after what go down in the Major 's office today he have his eye on you you really think there be a chance in hell I be go to sit this out that be what I figure see you tomorrow sleep well get in what be this about I want you to see something excuse we soldier you execute he no I send he back to New Bern early this evening he and three other armed man be find not far from here head towards Jericho when we try to apprehend they they make the mistake of open fire this man could not put his vendetta to rest so it be put to rest for he be they you ask I what I would 've do if those insurgent have take a shot at I this be what I would 've do sometimes the only way to end these thing be to start remove element from the equation I think you need to ask yourself if your father would 've want your story to end in one of these bag my father 's dead hey we need to talk about the deal you make with Stanley Richmond the paperwork 's go through as we speak tear it up I be sorry Mr Richmond sign those paper I be not really sure we be go to be able to void they out Stanley tend to sign thing without pay much attention among the thing he have sign be four year of misdated income tax return which make he guilty of a number of federal crime but it be my understanding that Cheyenne have extend an amnesty for non violent federal crime commit prior to the attack so technically I suppose you have expose Jennings Rall to a nasty civil suit for coerce he into this deal on the basis of a tax debt he no long owe yeah that sound like something I be go to need to raise with my boss it do do not it please do not stomp or make any sudden movement next to the stove okay you be make a cake I bake sometimes since when okay when I be a kid no you do not once I do in Home Ec and and it end badly because because of the fire right which could 've be prevent leave I alone this be for your mother it be be four week since your dad and she just want to stay out at the ranch do it her way okay well I be go to do it my way and this be her favorite recipe so no it be my dad 's he would beg she to make it for he and then he would sit right there and tell she how to do it she would pretend it drive her crazy it be it be a bit they do God he love she he love you too you know yeah most day how do you think he would have feel about Constantino get to walk I think he would have be madder than hell but I do not think he would have feel good about what you be plan you know I think he would have prefer his death end one war not not start another one yeah yeah I think so too Jake do Eric come talk to you no why 'cause he take a gun and go out with some of the Rangers Sam and Allison be at the Taylors I tell Margaret we be have problem at home I also get this you be right they be look for Sarah not you I tell you I do not want you to be part of this I know I ignore you this be no Robert okay we be in this together and I want to help what be this that be everything that be come through Beck 's fax machine in the last few day and these be copy I hope I put the original back in the paper tray within two minute what be that be you sure you be not follow yeah I do not think so d that be not a yes you know what to do hey what the hell be you do I be take care of this for the both of we by leave without I I be try to protect you you never would have agree to sit this out now go home Jake we be all go home not I this be not what Dad would have want Eric maybe not from you what the hell be that suppose to mean do you think you lose more than I be

say there be something rotten in that government who know if it stop with Valente or not the western state have all fall in with Cheyenne everything west of the Mississippi they be strong and get strong the East be align under Columbus Ohio remnant of the old administration and they be weak and lose support fast how far off be Cheyenne from win this thing that be where the wildcard come in an independent territory with a significant military presence and a massive stockpile of oil reserve and they have not choose a side yet Texas the Texans be get close to side with Cheyenne if that happen it be the ballgame this be our new mission Expose Cheyenne 's secret before they take over the whole country I guess this be where the good news come in yeah what be that I have evidence that could

this office I can understand that now tell I what you know I 've be push all morning with the Army no one can do anything about Goetz it be like he be completely above the law Goetz be not Ravenwood

here we get word there be some contraband in Mr Turner 's most recent shipment I will look the other way for most of it but I get a paycheck to justify can you just leave the med the med be the big problem Unregistered pharmaceutical could be taint and even cause an outbreak this will all be ship back to Cheyenne to be dispose of if Jericho need med J R will issue a safe supply thank for your help Sheriff do not worry about it Dale I will talk to he all right besides it do not look like he take that much it be not how much he take it be what he take there be something you guy need to hear

generic stuff be dangerous be almost nil but somehow there be only one legally approve source J R hello hello be anyone there hello this be Christina in Fall River Missouri be this another quarantine

go find Kenchy work out a way of inoculate as many people as possible as fast as possible I will figure out a way to get the vaccine back that that be not go to happen here about three month ago we find this John Doe break neck bury out in the wood near Tookany Creek be not hard to figure out that Sarah Mason be probably the perp what make you think that well look at his neck it be snap clean whoever do that know what they be do do you run print DNA well the CSI department 's be a little busy lately we 've be offline for a while all right run it see what it turn up you know when you do there be another set of print you should run as well think you can lift a set from that Jimmy Sure I will give it a shot okay whose print be those Sarah Mason 's I beg your pardon yeah we exchange fire almost have her corner but then she slip away leave that clip behind I 've already be give dossier on her what more can her print tell I that be what I be try to find out there how be that yeah Jimmy that be fine should I take it as a good sign you be not in jail yet the major be conflict there be still a part of he that be not completely sign up to Cheyenne yet what make you think that well he be not a guy try to wrap up a mission he be curious he want to know the truth that say I be go to need your help now that Darcy 's out of play I need somebody else to keep tab on the major yeah we may have a problem with that I be about to do something that might cost I my badge no no no look you be my only eye and ear in this place if nothing else that badge be one thing we can not lose what be go on with you Jake look I may not have a choice all right those print be not good enough no no here let us try these oh yeah that be well I be sorry I can not get involve in any of this I would not ask you if we be not in trouble this new administrator Goetz he be I know I have see what he be capable of and I will not go against he this might be our only chance to protect this town and we can not do it without you all right look I will tell you what you need to know you write it down okay you administer the vaccine in a fleshy part of the body okay no one who be ill no one who be get ill no one with egg allergy that be very important now child six month to two year pinch the fleshy part of the thigh administer the vaccine quickly the quick the well now we do not need to get everybody just 75 to 80 of high risk and then we 've achieve herd immunity Herd immunity I I yes herd immunity it be like when Kenchy please help I with this I hope I can help you usually the chief administrator handle the issue with local leadership the chief administrator be the issue here I need to know how to have Goetz transfer out of here I I do not think that I can do anything about that yeah I know there be a lot of that go on around here look I be not dispute J R 's authority to have a chief administrator Mr Green but Goetz Goetz murder dozen of innocent people in Rogue River and then in New Bern and if we have not fight he off here he would have do the same to we officially officially my answer be that Ravenwood personnel can only do their job if they be insulate from these kind of complaint but unofficially my answer be that the J R policy that protect Ravenwood be inexcusable it be one thing about this company that I do not understand and I wish I could change but I can not and neither can you you need to know that for every one of they there be one of I and if it be any consolation since the end of the lawlessness the report of Ravenwood violence have almost disappear all right well thank you for your time one last thing I be just curious have you be inoculate for the Hudson River Virus yet yeah it be the name of a town in Missouri they 've be hit bad by the Hudson River Virus the isolated outbreak in this area be all be handle be they yes they be be there something else I do not care what the official story be or what the news be report People in that town be watch their family die they need help and they be not get it it look like you be restock pretty fast so I be assume visit trading post be not all you 've be up to out on the road yeah Dale as Sheriff it be my job to tell you that even though the vaccine be head out on a J R transport today to be destroy in Cheyenne it would be a big mistake to hijack that truck I use to haul supply for J R and let I tell you they be very meticulous about inventory every bar code that leave at origin be track at destination or all hell break loose the only way someone could do it would be to

his base of operation Sir there be even surveillance Lieutenant you be excuse Sir leave the room now yes sir well it confirm my hunch Mason be Black Ops and these murder look like a clean up to I like some kind of top secret operation go bad so anyone connect to it have to die Safe to say she kill that John Doe at the house probably on the order of this same boss so the question now be what exactly

1942 1945 Johnston Green U S Army Rangers 1969 1976 both your father and grandfather be great soldier Mine too I know how hard it can be to live up to someone else 's legacy say here they both become mayor do you think they would have support the citizen of this town take the law into their own hand move it they never would have let it get that far excuse I they would have never hand over this town to a mercenary they do not have to do what I be do stop Americans from kill Americans put a country back on its foot open your eye it be not a country it be a company and you be just middle management the people of Jericho be go to take this town back you be go to have a revolt on your hand Halt it be not work he be dig in next step yes sir Sir we also have a call for you patch it through yeah this be Major Beck I have information on a terrorist you be hunt who be this I know you think you be search for Sarah Mason but she be be dead for a few month look at your fax machine who be I speak with the terrorist she work with kill she his name be Robert Hawkins and he have a nuclear bomb Jake Honey Jake Baby Jake look at I sweetheart Mom Mom what be you do here I hear you be in a little bit of trouble here have a drink of water come on honey there you go careful there you go that be well you okay sweetheart you can not keep this up and I can not stand to see you like this there be get to be another way Mom you should not be here now listen you just tell Major Beck whatever he want to know please and then he will release you no mom no I love you son Eric and the boy be come I love you stay alert do not give up Mom Mom this be Delta niner I have a visual come around for approach Fox One Fox Two he be in the tree we will wait for you to flush he out on the other side I deliver the message to Jake I need a map do you see where they take you no I be blindfold I could not see a thing but I can help you find he okay Beck put I in a Humvee and we take a right off of Main Street and then we just keep on go until we cross the Tacoma Bridge which mean we be head southeast and then we go straight for about maybe 20 minute and then we take a left on a gravel road and I think we be at the Levine farm but the road feel bumpy all of a sudden really bumpy like railroad track sound like you be out on 48 between Alex Bell and Lytle Five point that be at least five square mile can you remember anything else it smell terrible Hog farm this be definitely the place they 've get Jake two sentry at the door M4s and sidearm humvee driver that be it well what be we wait for let us go get he Target in sight Nighthawk Zero Six this be Fox Two we find the package Roger that Fox Two Jake come on help I cover we get he in Easy it be okay we get you now go go you escape you know you should have wait for daylight to try and burn I I might not have be so lucky I regret it have to come to that but you leave I little choice you 've get a problem now 'cause you tip your hand you do not just know where I be go you know exactly where I be and that mean you be track I how would I have do that I think that be where it get interesting because this phone be secure and the car be steal so the only way you could 've do it be to have a tracking device inside the bomb you sound paranoid yeah well that just may be but 14 year ago it be you that write the report detail how a massive nuclear terrorist attack would decapitate the federal government right and in that report you state that one individual with enough access could mastermind that entire attack see it make sense that whoever put those bomb in the field would have track device in every single one of they so he would know when they be in place you have the axe to grind you know the system Damn it be you who write the plan and then I think it be you who put that plan into practice you be not just some innocent whistle blower be you I believe that I be only the last time I blow the whistle I take out 23 american city Sir no sign of Jake Green or the Rangers no serious casualty from the raid of farmhouse what about the rest of the town Three dead all civilian another 14 wound three of they be ours we 've get 12 guy in lock up for various act of arson and you kill million ten of million of people why to liberate this country when I work for J R I see just how corrupt the relationship between the company and the federal government have become no bid contract a private army a corporation that write legislation J R be a cancer grow deep into the bone of this government so I decide to remove that cancer in one fell swoop well you fail because J R be more powerful now than they ever be they be also more vulnerable J R and the Cheyenne government be now centralize in one city so when I strike the final blow the disease should be go for good you be go to attack Cheyenne with your bomb but you do not have it the Cheyenne government do I know exactly how to get it back from the Cheyenne military and then I will finish what I start I be just sorry we could not do this together Mr Hawkins you listen to I I tell you what would happen if you ever lie to I if you ever try to play I I be go to bring this to you the next time we speak it will not be not be on this phone it be okay it be okay go back to sleep how long have I be out not long enough it be nice see you look peaceful for a change you okay yeah Darcy and the kid okay yeah give we a minute yeah Jake I lose the bomb the Army 's get it and right now it be on its way to Cheyenne what do that mean for Texas can Chavez hold they off it be not even about that anymore Jake the man behind the September attack be out there and he be pretty confident that he can get that bomb back and use it to destroy the city of Cheyenne there be over a million people live there now yeah a million innocent people because you can bet that his target Valente and the other they will not be among the dead and this will just give they the excuse to do whatever the hell they want to do you know if that bomb go off we will lose this country forever right Jennings Rall the Cheyenne government they know who I be so I need you to be okay because I can not do what I 've get to do alone when do we leave A²S Team www all about Subs fr previously on Jericho Bonnie 's dead Goetz be off limit no threat no retribution no exception Stanley I be declare Jericho to be an open insurrection western state have all fall in with Cheyenne Texans be get close to side with Cheyenne if that happen it be a ball game I have one of the bomb that bomb be the key to bring down this government they will never let you get it to Texas okay John Smith we find a package you be not just some innocent whistle blower the last time I blow the whistle I take out 23 american city the man behind the September attack be pretty confident that he can use it to destroy the city of Cheyenne when do we leave Mary arrange for we to meet one of her runner this side of the checkpoint on Route 309 he should be able to get we through to Wyoming hopefully just outside of Cheyenne we be on our own from there the street be go to be crawl with soldier from Cheyenne and mercenary from Ravenwood on police patrol and as I be enemy number one right now we be go to need someplace safe fast what about your contact there who Cheung yeah I get a lead on his location but it might take awhile to track he down we be go to need something more immediate look Jake yeah when we get out there the mission be everything yeah I get it no no see I get to be sure I be ask for your help but I can not afford for you to go off book out there and I do not have any room for debate so if you 've get any question now be the time yeah I 've get a question go ahead how be we go to find the bomb no idea anything else insurgent activity in your piece of the world have reach unacceptable level Major the Cheyenne government will not tolerate this your order be to begin Phase Three operation immediately Sir with all due respect I believe it be premature to move to phase three this place be still salvageable two prisoner escape your custody yesterday you 've lose three supply
