Romano you both seem more relaxed than I expect do you have some kind of surprise for the tobacco people I be do my own research if you be plan to continue with medical testimony you will only be invite further government interference we must police ourselves there be your slogan the medical thing be dead we understand that yes dead an apt choice of word consider the public be convinced that cigarette be poisonous if we can not insist that they be not I believe my most recent survey have provide a solution we can still suggest that cigarette be part of american life or too good to give up or most appeal an assertion of independence so basically if you love danger you will love smoke we can put a skull and crossbone on the label I love it before the war when I study with Adler in Vienna we postulate that what Freud call the death wish be as powerful a drive as those for sexual reproduction and physical sustenance Freud you say what agency be he with we be suppose to believe that people be all live one way and secretly think the exact opposite that be ridiculous let I tell you something Miss Guttman Doctor Dr Guttman psychology might be great at cocktail party but it so happen that people be buy cigarette before Freud be bear the issue here be not why should people smoke it be why should people smoke Lucky Strike suggest that our customer have a what do you call it a death wish I just do not see that on a billboard so what ifreader 's Digest say they be dangerous they also saidbambiwa the book of the century there be no proof there be conclusive proof that none of these low tar low nicotine or filtration system have any effect on the incidence of lung cancer just give I the damn report I think you will find it very convincing I be sure I will you be the one who find all of our medical testimonial in the first place that be true Mr Drape but I have anyone else see this of course not it be your account good I do not want to hear about it anymore I be sorry I just

kind of up to you Mr Draper our store be 60 year old we share a wall with Tiffany 's honestly a coupon Miss Menken coupon work I think your father would agree with the strategy he might but he be not

I see that you 've get your hand full do not want to be a bother nice meeting you hey you have great leg I bet you Mr Draper would like they if he could see they Sterling Cooper how may I direct your call I just do not know what we have to do to make these government interloper happy they tell we to make a safe cigarette we do it and then suddenly that be not good enough Might as well be live in Russia Mm Damn straight you know this morning I get a call from my competitor at Brown Williamson and they be getting sue by the federal government because of the health claim they make yeah we be aware of that Mr Garner but you have to realize that through the manipulation of the mass medium the public be under the impression that your cigarette be link to certain fatal disease manipulation of the medium Hell that be what I pay you for our product be fine I smoke them myself my granddad smoke them he die at 95 year old he be hit by a truck I understand but our hand be tie we be no long allow to advertise that Lucky Strikes be safe what the hell be we go to do we 've already fund our own tobacco research center to put this whole rumor to rest and that be a very good start but it may not affect sale Don I think maybe that be your cue well uh I have be uh think quite a bit about this and uh I mean you know I be a Lucky Strike man from way back so I might have a solution at Sterling Cooper we 've be pioneer the burgeon field of research and our analysis show that the health risk associate with your product be not the end of the world People get in their car every day to go to work and some of they die car be dangerous there be nothing you can do about it you still have to get where you be go cigarette be exactly the same so why do not we simply say so what if cigarette be dangerous you be a man the world be dangerous smoke your cigarette you still have to get where you be go that be very interesting I mean if cigarette be dangerous it would be interesting except they be not that be your slogan you be go to die anyway die with we actually it be a fairly well establish psychological principle that society have a death wish and if we could just tap into that the market potential be what the hell be you talk about be you insane I be not sell rifle here I be in the tobacco business we be sell America the Indian give it to we for shit sake come on Dad let us get out of here the bright spot be at least we know if we have this problem everybody have this problem gentleman before you leave can I just say something I do not know Don can you the Federal Trade Commission and Reader 's Digest have do you a favor they 've let you know that any ad that bring up the concept of cigarette and health together well it be just go to make people think of cancer yes and we be grateful to they but what Lee Jr say be right if you can not make those health claim neither can your competitor so we 've get a lot of people not say anything that sell cigarette not exactly this be the great advertising opportunity since the invention of cereal we have six identical company make six identical product we can say anything we want how do you make your cigarette I do not know Shame on you we breed insect repellent tobacco seed plant they in the North Carolina sunshine grow it cut it cure it toast it there you go there you go but everybody else 's tobacco be toast no everybody else 's tobacco be poisonous Lucky Strike be toast gentleman I do not think I have to tell you what you just witness here I think you do Advertising be base on one thing happiness and you know what happiness be happiness be the smell of a new car it be freedom from fear it be a billboard on the side of the road that scream with reassurance that whatever you be do it be okay you be okay it be toast I get it you have I worry I do not know if you be drunk or not drunk but that be inspire for the record I pull it out of thin air so thank you up there you be look in the wrong direction so now that I 've get you in the afterglow here what do you say you reconsider this presidential campaign I do not know bunting and baby that be hard work I would make hash of it Modesty that be

network that extend far beyond Madison avenue Europe south America we be publicly trade we issue dividend Small be bad do you know the kind of client we attract Pan Am Coca Cola Esso can you imagine the lifestyle that go with handle Pan Am it be a panty dropper Television you could be in that in a big way you know that but you want to sell corn we do a show about Indians imagine yourself in a three year contract 35 per antum security set in stone Sterling probably have not let you break 30 yet no comment I really do not like do this over the phone all I can say be eventually you come up

spanish speaker and hope this go away well Cooper think if Kennedy creep up any more in the poll Nixon will panic and they will get desperate for our effort he want everything in place More risk why be we do this again and out of pocket one do not question the wish of our client client come and go Campbell sometimes it be good to rid they of unrealistic expectation be you try to say that we can not win Nixon 's get an eight point lead in the poll not much and we still have not figure out a way to make an impact about the Nxon campaign 's involvement my marching order be undecided state I

spike the sample be very small but what we put out sell well more important be who it sell to this be an untapped market where you dictate the competition I think I can say this because Don 's be modest Don 's wife she be a peach of a girl they have a dinner party we be talk day after placement and she have this elaborate elegant setup food from around the globe and sure enough there be your Heineken right next to the bone china and the polished Sterling it be incredible not exactly scientific although it sound like you do know your wife she be exactly who we be after well off educate

I guess it must be true Burt Peterson 's firing be undignified Building security that be all I will say confirm a couple of rumor do he throw a desk chair against a window only to have it bounce back and knock he over not that I know of do he make a 2 in a file cabinet Burt Peterson live hard and love hard Harry here be an expert in medium Television the air not the set now admiral television sale be flat we know that but as we study your index we realize that they be not flat everywhere in fact among negro sale be actually grow we know that too you do no of course you do these be your number but I think we 've discover an interesting strategy this be Ebony by negro for negro Jet Space in these magazine cost far less than what you currently spend Daily newspaper that go just to this market for penny on the dollar and shift a portion of the medium budget from low indexing white area to this market where it can do more good they already like it we can make they buy more by increase the exposure a 5 sale bump in Detroit alone would make you the same profit as a 2 increase systemwide and ad on television gear to this market and white market will have double the effect a negro ad and a white ad so Campbell you be make twice the ad for we now no do they together integrate it I do not think that be legal of course it be legal look this conversation be not worth have who be to say that negro be not buy admiral television because they think white people want they Miss Olson be here to see you send she in oh sorry I know he do not need clothe but do not return it I be the young I

be not go to happen Peggy not now I be fight for paperclip around here third time it must be old hat you be go to be fine Peggy I look at you and I think I want what he have really you have everything

you go to the lady ' room you want to join I do you tell Don about duck that be none of your business Sure they hear you be shop around they will want you more but I I be share my job with Kenny I be already redundant you have relationship with your client that be leverage do you say something it be my decision pete if it be not Martin Luther King I should drop kick you off the roof admiral

little matter of the contract well do not be afraid to push back I agree to the New York hotel but everything else should be under our term I do not think you understand this be regard your contract or lack thereof it may seem like a formality to you but to Mr Hilton it be a necessity that all the principal in the firm be secure and honestly I can not blame he I will give he my word and he will take it but his lawyer will not obviously you will want your attorney to look it over that be Ben Michelson hmm it be fairly standard three year a non compete clause a healthy raise that be very generous I will think about it I be confused if someone hand I that contract I would be fill with glee a three year guarantee a 5 000 signing bonus I 've never see that before well we want to take care of he look I 've get to know Conrad Hilton a little bit and I think he will enjoy something he can'thave and you should tell he that it matter to I it matter to he still I do not think anyone
