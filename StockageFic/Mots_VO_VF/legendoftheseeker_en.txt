he prepare he what have you be do for the last 20 year let he catch worm Steal apple skin his knee find out what make his heart beat fast my sister give her life to make sure that I get here to make sure that I put the Book in the Seeker 's hand and he be catch worm never know a great man who do not have dirt under his nail while he be get his nail dirty do it ever occur to you to give he the slight inkling that he be the first true Seeker in the last thousand year he have a destiny who be you to decide a man 's destiny it be not I it be the Prophecy Prophecy be damn I avert the Prophecy when I bring he here until you open up a nice little door in the Boundary and say right this way to the Seeker lady and gentleman so it do not matter that Darken Rahl be grow more powerful every day that people in the Midlands be lose their freedom die by the thousand stop what be you talk about and what be a Seeker a Seeker be a hero who arise in a time of trouble and suffering and seek out evil and fight it wherever he can what do that have to do with I if you be so sure you avert the Prophecy that he be go to live a nice peaceful life why do you stay near he all these year tell he the truth tell he who he be first you need to know about a man name Darken Rahl if he be a man and not some twisted wraith of evil bring forth from the underworld to shatter the dream of humankind twenty three year ago a great prophet speak on his deathbed of the birth of a true Seeker a child whose destiny would be to seek out and kill the great evil of all Darken Rahl and with his last breath the prophet name the town in which the child have be bear Rahl send his assassin and in one night they murder every first bear son in Brennidon save one by the grace of the spirit word of the Prophecy find its way to I along with something Darken Rahl do not have your name your mother give birth in the madness of the massacre she be young she be weak Midwife do not think she would last the night she be still alive when I take you from her arm she kiss you bless you my mother die when I be 10 here in Hartland the woman you know as your mother raise you and love you as if you be her own but she do not give birth to you I cross the Boundary at night unseen with you in my arm for week I watched listen read the cloud and come to know that in all the world there be no one kind than George and Mary Cypher I tell they your story and they take you into their home and into their heart if I live to be a thousand year old I will never make a wise choice than pick they for the job so accord to this fantasy who be my real father I do not know and if you know my parent so well why do not I ever see you with they why have not you talk to I I keep myself apart close enough to keep watch over you but far enough away so that if Darken Rahl ever find his way to I I would not be a blaze arrow point the way to you apparently that be what confessor be for confessor an ancient order of woman swear to find the truth no matter how hard people may try to hide it and if a Seeker should arise to protect he with her life my name be Kahlan I be sorry for threaten you today you do save my life I come here to bring you this a book not just any book it be the Book of Counted Shadows it be write in a time before remember for a thousand year it be be keep safe in the Wizard 's Keep in Aydindril but a month ago the army of Darken Rahl break through our last defense in an attempt to steal it why because the Book contain the secret of power and if Darken Rahl get it he will use it to control every corner of the world and we would all become his slave the Prophecy say that the Seeker will use the Book in his quest to defeat Rahl Read it maybe this Seeker you be look for know this language but I do not try the truth of the word of the Book of Counted Shadows can only be ensure by a Confessor how because you be the true Seeker that be a good blade you 've get there I could use a tool like that where do you get it Trader from down south lead I to believe it be one of a kind but you know trader what be it Richard 's trail end here how be that possible he know how to mask his trail we will split up Cover more ground give he the Sword name he what sword this be the Sword of Truth in anyone else 's hand this be just a piece of steel but in the Seeker 's hand bestow the power to fight evil and with it you will kill Darken Rahl I be not kill anybody I do not even know either of you for all I know this be some kind of trick I be not a Seeker I do not want any book or any sword Calm down my boy I be not your boy my father be George Cypher and if any of this be true he would have tell I now get out of my way Richard wait let he go what he need to find the truth for himself until then he can not be name your First Councilor need more man on the North Hill he say I be to tell you to join he there tell I where to find your son do not make a sound what be that thing a Gar it use the blood fly to

this storm will never come Kahlan be right I should have prepare you what happen to your father be only the beginning of Rahl 's evil but you can stop he you and only you how in this life we can not go back only forward you have a great destiny ahead of you Richard Cypher if you be willing to accept it I 've lose everything not everything you have I and Kahlan and most importantly you have yourself everything your father bring you up to be and if you stop Rahl then your father and Kahlan 's sister will not have die for nothing teach I Richard Cypher though your road will be long and the outcome unknown will you undertake this journey I will will you leave behind your friend and all that you have know I will though the force of evil have swear to bring about your death still will you go on I will then will you accept a name of the Seeker I will then I First Wizard Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander so name you Lord Rahl what be it what be wrong the Seeker he live here be the river Fane go east towards the Boundary here how will we catch up without a bridge to cross there use to be another bridge south of here but it wash away I rebuild it so we will cross here and we will double back and pick up his trail there Fane be on a fast horse he do not know these wood like I do and he can not travel fast especially at night you could know every tree by name and he be still have a long lead on his way to a boundary that he have no way of cross then he must believe he can find a way then why be we still stand here talk Put your sword down Richard I do not want to fight you Chase but I will I 've know you since you be crawl on all four whose side do you think I be on I want to help you but first you need to tell I what in the name of the Spirits be go on I 've be so grateful to you all these year Fraden I believe you have do more for I than anyone and I reward you accordingly you 've be very generous Lord Rahl but now I find that you have fail I no my Lord I do exactly as you command my man and I kill every first bear son in Brennidon except the one that matter you let he slip through your finger be it possible my Lord be mistaken for 23 year I have sleep in peace certain that I have avert the Prophecy but then tonight it come to I in a terrible dream I see he take the Sword there be no mistake the Seeker have be name then let I assemble my man I will find he and complete the task and how will you do that the Seeker be a thousand league from here on the other side of the Boundary will your weary old bone carry you that far do you have a way across if this

my Journey Book Orders from Lord Rahl assemble our most powerful sorcerer deploy they with artillery battery at interval along the border they will use their magic to penetrate the Boundary once through our soldier be to find the Seeker and kill he so you be suppose to kill this Darken Rahl they say it be my destiny but to fulfill that destiny he need the Book of Counted Shadows the secret of power be write in its page if Darken Rahl learn they then we will not be able to defeat he that be why we have to find Fane before he get the Book to Rahl I know it sound crazy I always know you be mean for more than just clear trail you believe we you will help we find Fane well how can I say no to what do you call it the Seeker an inexperienced untrained Seeker we need to go now you need to

do use the Book just not in the way we expect more important he keep the Book from get into Rahl 's hand be the Seeker mean make difficult choice and Richard make the first of many today what about all the secret the Book be say to contain how will he defeat Rahl without know they well it appear the Seeker 's quest be not go to come with an instruction manual where to now the Boundary be open we

on an even foot my Lord the Seeker travel only with a Wizard and a confessor you have ten of thousand of subject and soldier who will obey your every command then let it be know throughout the three territory that whoever bring I the Seeker will be reward beyond imagine so where be we go exactly to find Rahl of course will not be easy he move from palace to palace temple to temple his spy be everywhere and it be say he have magic to cloak his movement and disguise his appearance so how will we find he one step at a time my boy one step at a time because where we do not find Rahl we will

thousand year he have a destiny who be you to decide a man 's destiny it be not I it be the Prophecy Prophecy be damn I avert the Prophecy when I bring he here until you open up a nice little door in the Boundary and say right this way to the Seeker lady and gentleman so it do not matter that Darken Rahl be grow more powerful every day that people in the Midlands be lose their freedom die by the thousand stop what be you talk about and what be a Seeker a Seeker be a hero who arise in a time of trouble and suffering and seek out evil and fight it wherever he can what do that have to do with I if you be so sure you avert the Prophecy that he be go to live a nice peaceful life why do you stay near he all these year tell he the truth tell he who he be first you need to know about a man name Darken Rahl if he be a man and not some twisted wraith of evil bring forth from the underworld to shatter the dream of humankind twenty three year ago a great prophet speak on his deathbed of the birth of a true Seeker a child whose destiny would be to seek out and kill the great evil of all Darken Rahl and with his last breath the prophet name the town in which the child have be bear Rahl send his assassin and in one night they murder every first bear son in Brennidon save one by the grace of the spirit word of the Prophecy find its way to I along with something Darken Rahl do not have

their home and into their heart if I live to be a thousand year old I will never make a wise choice than pick they for the job so accord to this fantasy who be my real father I do not know and if you know my parent so well why do not I ever see you with they why have not you talk to I I keep myself apart close enough to keep watch over you but far enough away so that if Darken Rahl ever find his way to I I would not be a blaze arrow point the way to you apparently that be what confessor be for confessor an ancient order of woman swear to find the truth no matter how hard people may try to hide it and if a Seeker should arise to protect he with her life my name be Kahlan I be sorry for threaten you today you do save my life I come here to bring you this a book not just any book it be the Book of Counted Shadows it be write in a time before remember for a thousand year it be be keep safe in the Wizard 's Keep in Aydindril but a month ago the army of Darken Rahl break through our last defense in an attempt to steal it why because the Book contain the secret of power and if Darken Rahl get it he will use it to control every corner of the world and we would all become his slave the Prophecy say that the Seeker will use the Book in his quest to defeat Rahl Read it maybe this Seeker you be look for know this language but I do not try the truth of the word of the Book of Counted Shadows can only be ensure by a Confessor how because you be the true Seeker that be a good blade you 've get there I could use a tool like that where do you get it Trader from down south lead

will you undertake this journey I will will you leave behind your friend and all that you have know I will though the force of evil have swear to bring about your death still will you go on I will then will you accept a name of the Seeker I will then I First Wizard Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander so name you Lord Rahl what be it what be wrong the Seeker he live here be the river Fane go east towards the Boundary here how will we catch up without a bridge to cross there use to be another bridge south of here but it wash away I rebuild it so we will cross here and we will double back and pick up his trail there Fane be on a fast horse he do not know these wood like I do and he can not travel fast especially at night you could know every tree by name and he be still have a long lead on his way to a boundary that he have no way of cross then he must believe he can find a way then why be we still stand here talk Put your sword down Richard I do not want to fight you Chase but I will I 've know you since you be crawl on all four whose side do you think I be on I want to help you but first you need to tell I what in the name of the Spirits be go on I 've be so grateful to you all these year

avert the Prophecy but then tonight it come to I in a terrible dream I see he take the Sword there be no mistake the Seeker have be name then let I assemble my man I will find he and complete the task and how will you do that the Seeker be a thousand league from here on the other side of the Boundary will your weary old bone carry you that far do you have a way across if this confessor find a way

its page if Darken Rahl learn they then we will not be able to defeat he that be why we have to find Fane before he get the Book to Rahl I know it sound crazy I always know you be mean for more than just clear trail you believe we you will help we find Fane well how can I say no to what do you call it the Seeker an inexperienced untrained Seeker we need to go now you need to rest Food fresh horse

do to deserve our help how do we decide who deserve it our help it should be enough that she need it do not be naive this be not Westland exactly Darken Rahl have force people of the Midlands to do anything to just survive include serve you up to the D'Harans People like she be only look out for themselves if the Seeker 's just out for himself what chance do they have I know where the Seeker be why have not you bring he to I he be be capture by whom a woman have he a woman yes but she do not want the bounty what do she want two patrol along the perimeter four sentry at the main gate a few

to help we he be the Seeker Richard we should get move well if you ever come back this way maybe we will see each other again you would well hope not the D'Harans have no intention of pay the bounty on the Seeker anyone who try to collect will find themselves inside a D'Haran prison cell besides the Seeker 's on our side he be fight for we the least we can do be help he out how do you do that it be call additive magic try to hold on to it this time it be the only thing I have of my father 's I be not let it out of my sight again I just want you to know that I really appreciate you look out

trophy I run the animal to the ground and watch it die the trophy be mine he be lie confessor he only wound the creature it be my arrow that kill it I can see that neither of you be sure whose arrow truly kill the creature so I can not fairly award the trophy to either of you be there someone you both know who could use the health and good luck such a trophy would bring Gethin 's wife have be ill then give the trophy to Gethin and forgive each other for this feud yes confessor thank you as you both agree to abide by the covenant of the Confessor I will now hear your dispute there be more people here now than there be when we get here Patience Richard this valley have not see a confessor in year do you have any idea how much bad blood can flow when people have no one to settle their dispute how do she know who be tell the truth a Confessor have power beyond her magic she often sense the truth without use her touch she can ferret out lie and heal the rift that come from keep secret and everybody just do what she say a Confessor be the high moral authority in the Midlands People abide by her judgment we be head out on a hunt probably no more than a day 's ride we would be honor to have your company what be you hunt Worthy prey a 14 point buck Richard can not what excuse we you can not just ride off on your own back in Hartland I be on my own all the time sometimes for day that be before you be the Seeker before Darken Rahl want to kill you Gavin and Matthias will be with I it be not safe Lesson number 15 in honor what other most honor the Seeker shall win their heart Hunting be their most honored tradition when it be convenient you remember your lesson Kahlan will be busy for day Zeddicus Zu'l zorander it be you I hear there be a wizard in the camp but I hardly dare to imagine you promise you would never forget that night at the Fire Springs Sylvia if I recall it be more than one night so we be agree then you will spend time with your friend I will go hunt which way be you go the stag be see head east remember not everyone in the Midlands be friendly be careful you too this be one crafty stag now he be turn west then let us go west I think we be league from the near town the stag have lead we far than I think that be Brennidon Brennidon you know it I be bear there I be surprised Zedd do not tell I we be close by you be not he do not expect we to be ride west how long since you 've be there not since I be a baby I wonder which house be mine where my parent live do your parent still live there I do not know do not you wanna find out I tell Zedd I would stay with you but it would not hurt to take a look around for an hour or so and maybe we will have take the stag by the time you catch up with we all right a terrible sight be not it who be they the firstborn son of Brennidon murder by Darken Rahl 's man to avert a prophecy the Prophecy of the Seeker you know of it I 've hear the story you 've hear of it it be not just a story all these child be murder because of it the Seeker among they and when he die so do Brennidon 's future maybe the Seeker be out there somewhere ready to rise up and defeat Darken Rahl Twenty three year have go by and Rahl be advance through the Midlands no Seeker have surface so if he live he be a coward and our child have die for nothing Sync Kasius Papers please all right clear come on who be next you where be your pass Pass no pass no entry this young woman have be preach heresy gather her friend tell they that Lord Rahl be not our true leader we all know the consequence of defy Lord Rahl for the past 20 year you have choose to live by certain standard allow those of we from the patrol to protect you this girl think she know well than the town elder we must cast rebel out publicly so Lord Rahl know we will never defy he again may your rebellious spirit wander the underworld for all time you can not kill she just for speak her mind who be you show I your paper just let she go this do not have to be a fight take he the Sword of Truth it be the Seeker arrest he run hide yourself alert the sentry close the gate Split into two go around the other side I want to help you follow I the Seeker go this way thank you for help I look at you you know I I hold you in my arm the night you be bear and then the Wizard take you away be you say you be my mother if you surrender the army it be go to upset the townspeople we have an agreement if we submit to Darken Rahl 's rule Brennidon would be free of your force the agreement be not for your benefit Lord Rahl feel occupy the town might discourage the Seeker from return your part of the bargain be to deliver he to we if he come back I alert you as soon as you alert I only after the Seeker have slip through your finger now I have no choice but to bring in my own force give we some time the Seeker be within the city wall he could not have escape we be search every house in Brennidon he will be in your hand here before nightfall he would well be I call you Owen after your father my father he pass away not long after do the Wizard give you to good people very good people I can see they 've raise a fine man what you do to save that girl they be go to kill she and everyone be just go to stand around and watch People be terrify of Darken Rahl I do not understand Rahl do not kill the child of this town because you defy his edict Rahl give a warning before the massacre he ask the town elder to identify which child be the Seeker turn he over they refuse so Rahl massacre all the child and now people be scared that if they anger Rahl even in the slight way he will send his assassin back so you let these patrol control everything you do and say many of we think that it be wrong to give up our freedom to appease Rahl but you see what happen to the people that speak out but now the Seeker be back ready to fulfill his destiny and maybe now that you be here the rest of we will find the strength to stand with you Mom they be say the Seeker be in town but the Seeker be kill no Mark he be not this be Richard he be the Seeker I be your brother I be glad you be back Zedd I be afraid I will not be stay my dear of course you 've always have some high calling to follow this search for a mythical creature that hunt for a lose spell at least your excuse for leave be always more interesting than most man 's but this time your duty lie here what do you mean Allard I want you to meet Allard your son my mother never say my father be a great Wizard I be not your father of course you be he be get your color your eye every time I look at he I see you you must be under an illusion spell it be your duty as his father to train and teach he the way of the world he be a grown man who you abandon he be no child of mine I take precaution magical precaution maybe I should wait outside you be in the throe of passion by the time you would even think of take precaution he be not my son and I will prove it how confess we about what it be a matter of paternity you tell I my brother be dead everyone need to think he be dead until he could fulfill his destiny as the Seeker if anyone know he would survive Darken Rahl would have pursue he to the edge of the world if they find he they will execute all of we they be search the house now he be right I have to leave I do not want you to go I go back I will find my friend tell they what happen in Brennidon we will find a way to help you come on keep search you know the patrol Mark could not you get one of they to help we I could hide he until nightfall maybe ask the gatekeeper I might be able to get he to look the other way this one you will not find anything here down here this place have be empty for year no one come here you will be safe in the cellar thank for your help I be not try to help you Mark do not do this please you have to come I 've catch the Seeker this way how could a boy like you capture he he defeat my good man so I trick he I can take you there well where be he there be no possibility of anyone else be Allard 's father there be another man Steffan but I only see he once Vixen this Steffan must be the father or it could be you it be your turn be you Allard 's father I use protection magical protection and this magic could it have fail never it be my own spell it be foolproof and you use it every time you be honor bind to tell a confessor the truth not in front of her leave we be there an occasion when you do not use your magic unless you be completely truthful unless you confess whatever it be that you be hide I can not absolve you of your responsibility to Allard we will gather more man we will search the house again whoever hide he will hide he again nobody in Brennidon would dare someone hide he 23 year ago think Andrew who would feel such loyalty to the Seeker his mother perhaps but we do not know who the Seeker 's mother be we can find out you there where be you go the Seeker may have escape I have order to search outside the gate we 've receive new order patrol be to gather the mother of the firstborn and take they to the town square the mother to force the Seeker out of hiding I help you leave she alone Zedd be not Allard 's father but he be hide something but that do not concern your dispute this be my final judgment yes confessor I be sorry Zedd I really hope that you be Allard 's father I think he might be happy with you why he do not even know I wizard be strong their strength come from their mind not their body she do not want to say be but I be hopeless as a hunter that be not true as a child you be fearless do something happen to make you fearful what be it a boar hunt you never go on a boar hunt I be only 8 you would have say I be too young but I go with Rolant and Merrick I got catch between they and the boar and I be so scared you do not lose your skill you be just frightened it do not matter if I be ask on a hunt I can not I think I can help you hurry there do not delay move along Brigid the D'Harans they 've come back what I want be simple give the Seeker to I then everyone can go back to their life what happen here 23 year ago be a tragedy but it be necessary for the great good he speak the truth I think we 've all see that Darken Rahl will do anything to bring peace to the Midlands see this woman be wise listen to her what be Lord Rahl to do face the Seeker as a grow man who could defend himself and carry out the Prophecy he have to kill our child the Seeker stand up to the patrol this morning he save a girl 's life no one else have have the courage to do that if we betray the Seeker because we be afraid then the child of Brennidon die for nothing silence she I be the one you be look for I be the Seeker 's mother but I will never help you find he arrest her she be protect I the Seeker be my son not hers he be my son no I be the Seeker 's mother no he be my son arrest they all the Seeker have until sunrise to turn himself in if he do not I will kill one of these woman and I will kill another for every hour that the Seeker be not find do not call for the patrol just listen to I I need your help my mother be arrest because of you why would I help you to save she there only way to do that be to turn yourself in and then what you go back to your life your mother come home and everything return to normal you hear what your mother say back in the town square your mother want a well life for you she want the people of Brennidon to stand up for themselves if I turn myself in her sacrifice mean nothing the only thing the D'Harans care about be the Seeker once you be go then the D'Harans will go too I would never even hear of the D'Harans until they kill my father and I have another brother back in Hartland Michael I love he but the D'Harans turn he against I so now I know exactly what they be capable of and I know that give in will not stop they what do you want I to do after he escape from the cellar I search for he everywhere I could not let he destroy Brennidon you 've do well you have what you want now let the woman go and why should I do that they 've all defy Lord Rahl please they be only try to protect I I truly be the Seeker 's mother maybe or maybe you be just protect the other either way they all defy Lord Rahl and must be punish she be tell the truth she be the Seeker 's mother and she be the one who be try to hide he from you how do you know this boy because she be my mother too you would betray your own mother she betray Brennidon she be not my mother anymore these other woman they be just be foolish try to help a misguided friend you be a very capable young man and to show the people of this town that Lord Rahl be merciful I will release the other woman you however will die alongside your son Lord Rahl will be please by your loyalty you will be reward there be only one thing I want to be there when you kill he you will have a place of honor at my side open the gate spread the word I want everyone in Brennidon and the outlying countryside in attendance I will kill the Seeker at midday I want you to summon the fear that you 've hold for so long bring it to the surface concentrate on the flame that be good Allard now think about how helpless you feel when the boar attack you feed your fear to the fire the fire consume your fear that be good Allard and with the flame so go your fear be you sure it work you question the magic of a Wizard of the first order of course not I be right to come to you what kind of spell be that it be not a spell I make it up Allard could not let go of his fear until I make he think magic have drive it out he may not believe it himself but he believe in the power of a great Wizard you be a crafty old devil Zedd I be sorry I have to make you tell I something you do not want to I 've keep that secret bury for 20 year I would like it to remain bury and by your honor as a confessor you must never tell Richard no matter what happen I be so glad that I get to see you we be go to get out of here I do not think so I have a plan Mark 's agree to help I I 've tell he exactly what he need to do Mark betray you he betray both of we Mark need to be at the platform at the execution but his eye they be so cold his whole life he be listen to what the patrol preach he think he be keep Brennidon safe until now I I do not realize what grow up in this town have do to he listen to I what Mark do be a trick and Mark would do anything to save you this be a horrible thing for a mother to say about her own child but I do not know if he be strong enough what if instead of trick the D'Haran he be really trick you rabbit where be that stag I be hungry for venison it be crafty than we think there be only two of we track it we will get it next time only two where be Richard he be not back he must have decide to stay long in Brennidon Brennidon you say you be travel east Brennidon 's west league from here well the stag turn west you say Richard be just go hunt Darken Rahl know the Seeker be from Brennidon he could have man wait there for he why do not you warn he he be the most stubborn man I 've ever meet if I tell he we be near Brennidon no amount of cajoling would have convince he not to go Brennidon be the last place he should be why be there such a crowd what go on here friend the D'Harans have capture the Seeker he die at midday make room make room you will watch your son die as you should have 23 year ago and then you will die for your treachery the legend of the Seeker seem to be great than the man that legend will live on if you kill I I be go to kill you Seeker with your own sword now Seeker the Prophecy at last be avert now you be wrong D'Haran the Prophecy be not avert I would never truly betray you you be suppose to stay with the hunter what be you think you promise you would not go off on your own I do not intend to but if I have not have come here I would not have find my mother your mother be alive I know that if you turn up I would have to tell the truth I be sorry I will always love you like a son but I be not really your mother I do hold you as a baby the night you be bear I be the midwife at your birth I be there when Zedd take you from your mother 's arm why do you pretend when you ask I if I be your mother I do not mean to say yes but it be suddenly as if I be look at my own lose son Owen the D'Harans kill he he be 3 I be so sorry I could not bear to think about his death I imagine that he be the one that have survive so when I see you in the square it be it be like my Owen have return at least now I know that he do not die for nothing what about my real mother she be very ill for a while but she live and then one day she disappear I never see she again I think she go to look for you the D'Harans may return Mark and I will not be here to help if the D'Harans return they will get a fight you 've teach we to stand up for ourselves besides you be the Seeker you 've get big thing to do than look after one town take care of your mother you know I will you be right about what insist on the lesson the training I know I 've be push you and now I understand why what I see in Brennidon make I realize what I be face and I be go to do whatever it take to be ready and now that I know that my mother be alive when all this be over I be go to find she and someday I be go to have a family again why do not you tell he because if Richard know he would risk his own safety for mine and his life be far more important nobody hope more than I that we find Richard 's mother and there be nothing I want more than to tell he the truth and someday when all this be over then we will have story to tell but until then he can not know that I be his grandfather they be definitely dragon corps

truth that be the confessor part or she can compel he to do unimaginable thing I see she do it back in Hartland she make a D'Haran soldier kill his comrade I do not understand what be happen but why do Rymus come back and the way he be look at her it one of the repercussion of Kahlan 's power the confess fall in love with the woman who confess he in love I do not understand it be complicated I

free will they become like a slave I do not believe I t 's not right to continue force they to do my bidding any long than I have to even someone like Rymus People deserve a chance to change to become well than what the world make they your instinct as a Seeker it lead you to the boy you could use it to find Zedd it be not any Seeker instinct but you find Jack the barmaid at the tavern slip something in my drink one of those potion what that be how I find Jack it have nothing to do with I but it do work I could go back and get more Magic be not mean to be use in that way you use magic you confess Rymus I be bear with this power I do not buy it in a tavern what be the difference you 've see what these potion can do what happen to the village to Jack I know you wanna protect I cause

everything we believe in everything I teach you those teaching be from another era old friend Rahl be not play by any rule and that justifie exploit these villager their life be dreary they be suffocate under Rahl 's edict the magic give they an escape Magic be rare it be special you can not just sell it on the street to anyone for a few copper coin in the wrong hand it ruin live it kill one village be a small price to pay if we can save the rest of the Midlands you 've forget more about magic than I will ever know if we work together we can find other wizard and sorcerer work for Rahl drain they of their magic create a me powerful army you expect I to help you hear I out I 've hear more than enough tell they to move what be you do I be sorry old friend my work be too important

word from I and my little friend will make a meal out of you cut I loose and I will tell he to let you go the quillion will absorb all of your power in a matter of hour then not even the rat will follow you but it do not have to be this way where be your militia Jeziah all I see be thug and thief be they go to be the general in your army of the Midlands if you want to fight Rahl you could be out there do it now but you be not be you I need time and money to build an army how much more do you need the villager have give you everything they own be you sure you be not just make yourself rich use magic to acquire power over other do not judge I Zeddicus you of all people have no right you run away at the moment you be need most I leave to protect the Seeker be you sure you be not really protect yourself use magic for your own gain you say you want to destroy Rahl you be just like he and you be just an old fool here be you angry with I I be not angry your forehead wrinkle when you be upset I be not upset I be you all right maybe I should not go for the potion but you have to admit it be work when you 've a problem that can not solve with magic what will you do then Richard I will protect you I tell you to leave you tell I to leave the village and I do but I love you too much to be out of your sight I will not leave you again my lady Richard Richard do not hurt he he try to kill I he think he be protect I I be prepared to die for her be you he can not help it he be not in control of his feeling we have to find Zedd which way I do not know the potion I think it be wear off Pack everything we be leave as soon as the quillion have do its work why no one can find we here he be travel with the Seeker do you want I to kill he I do not know which be more merciful to kill he or force he to live without his power this be his fault if he have not delay we you work for they you know where their cave be I only know about the temple where be you go back to the tavern you can do it without the potion you be the Seeker the Seeker of truth not of wizard the potion 's get we this far it can help we the rest of the way what would Zedd say if he be here if he see you rely on magic instead of your wit and your sense you can do this without magic I believe in you I do not know where to start the vision you have of Zedd what do you remember it be dark there be green on the wall Glittermoss do that help we it only grow where there be fresh water nearby like a river or lake Echo lake be not far that must be it there be a lot of cave it could take we day to search they the moss be be feed by water drip downward it be below the waterline the Lowlands south of the lake there be only a few cave there take we I only follow her order take we there Glittermoss Zedd Zedd my boy they 've take my power they be not mask their trail they be move fast they must not have time there they be stop the cart there be only two of they you forget who be after we stop they that be the wizard who steal my power my lady I will save you strike I down if you can Seeker to see that which be not there gaze upon what be Kahlan Richard the wizard no no oh my lady try not to move all my life I 've be a thief a liar thank you for let I die with honor you should kill I we be take you to a healer you will wear the Rada'han for the rest of your life you will never have the power of a wizard again old friend you know he I think I do you all right I 've absorb most of my power not quite back to my old self maybe in a couple of day maybe one thing I 've learn about magic it be that nothing be guarantee Magic tear this town apart I use it twice I be go back a 3rd time if Kahlan have not stop I accord to she it be your tracking skill that find I in the end it be our training that help you defeat Jeziah but if I have not use the potion I would not have know you be in a cave you could have die so then magic be a good thing Rymus would not have help we if kahlan have not use magic to confess he true enough but on the other hand he would still be alive I can see why it be such a burden for her so what lesson do you draw from all this Seeker there be not any easy answer Magic be not good or bad it be complicated that be lesson number six you be make these up be not you Richard I find something that belong to you how do you confessor can be quite persuasive I can not thank you enough everyone in this village be in your debt even if they be not go to be happy about it your neighbour have to learn to fix their problem without magic maybe you can show they how I excuse I one rise please a white one five penny be it for her no it be for you I never see anyone buy flower for the flower girl I know this do not make up for what I do but I hope someday we can be friend maybe there be hope for they maybe for they but not for the two of you what be you talk about Richard have feeling for you you be imagine thing to see that which be not there gaze upon what be I see the way he look at you and how you be start to notice he but you know neither of you can ever act on these feeling so the question be be you go to tell he or shall I this be terrible what do you

it find its way back into Commander Morcant 's pocket you pay he for information the bribe simply ensure repeat business his big mouth do the rest hopefully your investment will pay off we need some of that information we 've learn from an informant that Darken Rahl be mass troop at a place not far from here it be call Kelabra Most only speak that name in a whisper if they speak it at all it be once the most opulent city in the Midlands until an invading army lie siege to it rather than surrender the Kelabran people kill themselves their last die act be to curse anyone that enter the city wall one year to the day Mount Mariah erupt bury the invader beneath in a rain of molten rock and destroy all trace of that once glorious city what would the D'Harans want with it I dunno it be a forsake wasteland tomorrow I will pay Commander Morcant a visit if I know the commander he will not be able to keep his mouth shut about it gryff thiis Kahlan and her friend Zedd and Richard the first true Seeker in a thousand year it be an honor the Sword of Truth so it be true about the nick on the hilt the last true Seeker Kieran get it in the Battle of Barrier Peaks I always wonder where it

's family have their name but not much else the union will restore her family 's wealth and my father will have her family 's influence to strengthen the resistance but I would rather be fight Darken Rahl than marry a girl I hardly know you know part of I envy you you get to settle down get marry raise a family that be something I may never get to do but you have Kahlan do not you but we be not I think maybe you be do not you need to be get ready for your wedding Bronwyn 's a lucky girl and you will make a fine husband you must not go to Kelabra how do you know in two day ' time the Seeker will die at Kelabra this I have see in a vision a vision of one possible future one you can change if you stay away from that dread place who be you that matter not you will know what I say be true when you set eye upon the eagle whatever they have plan at Kelabra it be big they 've be ship in barrel of Dragon 's Breath a highly explosive ore they must be arm for an attack but on what they already control the region I could not find out exactly what they 've be plan but Darken Rahl 's appoint someone to oversee the operation a man call Nass Demmin Nass you know he only by reputation Nass be Darken Rahl 's most trust commander he be a butcher a ruthless enforcer if he be dispatch his right hand man to Kelabra I hate to think what Rahl be plot maybe this be the chance we 've be wait for I mean we can never find Darken Rahl because he be always change his location but if this Demmin Nass be his most trust commander would not he know where he be if we can infiltrate the encampment at Kelabra and get close to Demmin Nass I could confess he and we would have one of Rahl 's inner circle as our ally and if we can find Rahl we can kill he my man be to deliver provision to the D'Harans but if you take my supply wagon and make the delivery you can get inside the encampment this be a map of the encampment up at Kelabra I manage to steal it while Morcant be not look when you set eye upon the eagle the eagle this woman tell you the Seeker will die at Kelabra this mission be already risky enough without a vision of the Seeker 's death we need to find out how she know we be go to Kelabra otherwise we could be walk into a trap you well hurry accord to Morcant Nass will be at the encampment for only one day if we try to find this woman we could miss our only chance at

the supply wagon up to the encampment the D'Harans will take the crate to the command tent only there will not be provision inside the crate there will be you two I will need to get nass alone if I be go to confess he it will not be easy with all those soldier any idea Seeker we should never do that which your enemy will do for you what do you say it be just something the Seeker of the Third Era use to say he be a shrewd tactician I know I be just surprised you do I read about it in the book Gryff give I it have all the history of Seekers past I be glad to see you be learn from those who come before you what would the Seeker of the Third era suggest a diversion good idea we could ignite their stockpile of Dragon 's Breath that would distract the soldier and follow D'Haran military protocol they would take Demmin Nass to the safety of the command tent where Richard and I would be wait to confess he let the D'Harans do our work for we perhaps one day future Seekers will be quote you to my son Gryff and his lovely bride Bronwyn to Gryff and Bronwyn if these thing be not comfortable we can take they off what be wrong with you you know tradition do not allow it it stay on until morning after we 've spend our first night together as man and wife I too would like to offer my congratulation to the bride and groom it be so wonderful to see a union of two soul a union that I have no doubt will honor Darken Rahl and all he so nobly fight for join I in raise a glass in tribute to Lord Rahl I be afraid there be some press business that I must attend to there be a lot of thing I want to say but first let I start by wish my little sister and her new husband many many child we should get start on that right away I do not realize you be so eager I be believe I shall we I know this be go to be really hard for you to believe but I be not who you think I be my name be Richard Cypher I be the Seeker right I be the Confessor I be tell you the truth I do not know if it be a spell or some enchantment but whatever it be when people look at I they think I be Gryff maybe that be because you be Gryff no I be the Seeker now it seem that you do not have a love for Darken Rahl so will you please help I get out of here so I can get to Kelabra and help fight the D'Harans I can not believe this do you actually think I want to marry you then why do you this be all my brother ' idea after our parent die they expect this marriage to save the family 's future even if it mean ruing mine I do not know I be sorry you be sorry I think get married would at least mean I would get out of

the Sword of Truth and I have you I be afraid that might not be enough what be it to commemorate the victory at Illya the Seeker of the Third Era commission a magnificent dome to be build at Aydindril after 40 year of carefully place the stone all that remain be move the last would not support would all their work crumble to the ground or would it float among the cloud the dome at Aydindril have stand for thousand of year I think the lesson be if you want something to stand you have to risk let it fall what would the Seeker of the Third Era say about confessor that worry too much I be not too sure what he would say but this Seeker would tell you that he would die for you Richard no you should not say that I can not help it it be how I feel I can not we can not Kahlan wait this can never happen I be sorry Bronwyn you be right I should not have pretend to be somebody else but neither of we want this what choice do we have now we be stuck with each other maybe not you say you want to see the world right then let us go right now when we be far enough away from here we will get this thing off and we can go our separate way this be solid gold you can take it and sell it for enough money to start whatever life you want how out that window how long it will take they to realize we be not there I be not sure but we will be long go by then you be not go anywhere it be okay just do not hurt the girl drop it Seeker or the girl die be you all right that man he call you Seeker you be tell the truth before you really be he take this now will you be all right to get through the forest on your own I be come with you it be too dangerous my friend be about to attack the D'haran camp with someone who be not the Seeker I have to move quickly then you need I I know a shortcut to Kelabra through the cave if your friend really be in danger then the fast way to reach they be for I to take you these cave lead to the catacomb at Kelabra never think this be where I would spend my honeymoon well you and I be not exactly married I know but this be the first time in my life I feel like I be do something important which be a lot well than be the wife of a merchant 's son well you do not know the real Gryff you should give he a chance he be more than you think I would rather go fight the D'Harans than marry someone I have nothing in common with Funny Gryff say the same thing about you what be it nothing I do not have to be a confessor to know you be not tell the truth Richard almost kiss I last night this be exactly what I fear would happen you can not put off tell Richard the truth any long I know I be just worried about the mission I do not want this to be a distraction clearly it be already a distraction Kahlan I want to apologize for last night I should be the one apologize it be okay if you do not feel the same way about I no that be not it there be something I should have tell you a long time ago a Confessor 's power be always present we have to hold it in at all time be that difficult especially if I be with someone I love then the power could not be control in a moment of ecstasy it would be unleash my lover 's soul would be take then he would become a slave that be why we can never be together you would not be yourself anymore and you could not fulfill your destiny I be sorry Richard General Nass it be a pleasure to have you with we Pleasure be not why I be here of course you will be happy to know our plan be ahead of schedule good then Lord Rahl will have his victory soon than expect the excavation be progress well commander we

D'Haran cause or they be spy lock they up I will find out who they really be you be suppose to be on your honeymoon Gryff what could possibly have make you want to come here I would think you should be more concerned with how my father will react to you treat I this way he be always be loyal to you Nass be determined to question you there be nothing I can do then I guess there be nothing I can do either when Nass question I I be go to tell he all about the bribe my father have be pay you keep your voice down there be nothing I can do you can help I escape I think we would agree it would be good if I be not here Infantry halt special provision for Commander Morcant that have to be delievere to the commander tent what be you look for there have to be something here that will tell we what Nass be do at Kelabra what do it say I I can not read this of course you can I do not even know what language this be you 've read it before it be the same as the Book of Counted Shadows who be you the fuse be light we can not go through with this what be you talk about he be not the Seeker he be Gryff I think that old woman have do it to try to save Richard to prevent her vision of the Seeker 's death from come true the Seeker 's death that be why the old woman do this I be suppose to die in his place we 've to abandon the mission we be under attack it be a little late for that get General Nass to the command tent now I 've to get out of here you can not Nass be on his way but I be not the Seeker that will not matter to Demmin Nass the Seeker no I be not he get up you okay the mine be collapse where be the commander Commander the tunnel be collapse we have to move now come on it appear the old woman 's spell last just long enough to revert her vision of your death it be be a long time since I 've see magic that powerful listen what you tell I last night I know it be mean for Richard but after worry all this time I tell the wrong person you should tell Richard this be for you it tell the history of Seekers past I just want to say I be sorry for go along with the old woman 's plan I know there be more to be the Seeker than wield a magic sword I guess I just want to make a difference you do not have to be the Seeker to do that I hear you got marry it be a lovely ceremony I just have to do what I have to get back to you and Zedd I be glad you do be you all right I be fine it appear the resistance have grow by two would 've be three if we be able to confess Demmin Nass the important thing be we keep Gryff from harm and and avert the vision of the Seeker 's death we do more than that we find this maybe it can tell we what he want at Kelabra it be a record of the day Kelabra fall with the wall crumble the Kelabrans kill themselves to protect the city 's great secret and what be the secret the final resting place of their great treasure a Box of Orden what be it there be three box of orden each one contain unimaginably powerful magic whoever gain possession of all three box would be unstoppable Darken Rahl would enslave the entire world he would be invincible General Nass the Seeker and the other have escape into the forest we have what we come for we must bring Lord Rahl his prize prepare your man we leave for the People 's Palace immediately soon Lord Rahl will have all three box and the Seeker will be finish it be good to see you alive Seeker

be kind Zedd you know she once when I be a foolish young Wizard and venture into that seductress ' lair few have ever complain few have ever live long enough to I should 've kill you when I have the chance who be she a powerful sorceress who rule Agaden Reach use her twisted magic to shape event in her favor and she be no friend of the Seeker nor be I a friend of Darken Rahl if he gain dominion over this world I will be enslave by his magic I must help the Seeker for the Prophecy say only he can defeat Darken Rahl then why play these game Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander would accept no help from I with good reason I suggest we get as far away from this witch as we possibly can you can run from I but you can not run away from the prophecy what be you talk about I live we avert your prophecy that be a vision a momentary glimpse of a possible future something write in the hall of prophecy can not be change and what be this prophecy it be write that the Seeker will be betray by the one close to he you will be betray by the one in white Mistress Denna General Nass I wish I could say this be a pleasure the Seeker have be track I try to get his hand on the Box of Orden he must be stop you command an entire legion General surely you can kill one man I have receive new order you be to capture the Seeker and train he I think Lord Rahl want the Seeker dead Lord Rahl 's plan have change 1x08 Denna Sync Kasius wait we be be follow be you sure you can not help he or yourself why Kahlan wake up it be just a dream everything be fine it be just a dream I kill you good thing it be just a dream what if it be not what be you talk about what else could it be a premonition you be not go to kill I but the Prophecy Shota say I would betray you you know what Zedd think of her we can not trust she she be a witch a very powerful witch one who know what be write on the hall of Prophecy the one in White will betray the Seeker you could never do anything to betray I ever it go against everything you believe in I be a danger to you I know we have not know each other long but in my whole life there be no one that I 've trust more care about more I you what this be not right why not you do not understand you be right I do not this this can never be there be two road to Briamont we should approach from the south I be not come with you what be you talk about it be too dangerous for I to be near Richard be this because of what that she devil Shota tell you about some Prophecy I know you think Prophecy can be avert you try to do it when you take Richard into Hartland but it do not work do it forget what I believe you can not abandon Richard I be not abandon he I be protect he from what exactly you be right I do have feeling for he last night I I almost lose control of those feeling if I have not stop myself Richard would 've be lose forever the Prophecy would 've be fulfil but you do stop yourself maybe next time I will not be able to you be strong than that you would never let that happen not on purpose no but how be I to know how the Prophecy will come to pass I could betray he because of a spell or a trick all I know be the Prophecy can not be avoid all I know be that the Seeker need his confessor I 've think of that Most Confessors have go into hiding since Rahl 's be hunt we A Confessor I know have take refuge in a settlement a couple day from here you take an oath I know but there be other way that I can help Richard I be not give up on he or his mission but I can not stay by his side your feeling for Richard be what make you afraid child and I can not imagine how hard it must never to have what ordinary young people have but Richard be strong too and if you tell he the truth he will understand and you will find a way through this maze together I know Richard if he know how I feel about he he will not let it go he will follow I try to convince I that there be a future for we but there be not that be why he can never know how I feel about he promise I what be go on you can not go I need you Zedd need you every minute I stay I be a danger to you I would be dead right now if it be not for you you may be dead soon or bad if I stay bad than dead what be you talk about this have something to do with what happen last night confessor may be good at read people but you be not good at lie I be sorry I kiss you I will not do not it again if it upset you but you kiss I back that be a mistake look I in the eye and tell I you do not have the same feeling for I that I have for you I do not have any feeling for you and I never will how could you just let she go what would you have I do Spin a wizard 's web around her you could 've at least take my side there be something you be not tell I Lesson 18 Seeker keep to the path ahead not the road behind Richard behind you Mord Sith Richard we can not fight they we have to leave now do not use the Sword get the old man we 've lose the Wizard we have what we come for you may call I Mistress Denna be you tired tell I where my friend be when you be ask a question you will answer be you tired would you like to sleep I be not even go to close my eye till I get out of this place then you will be a very weary boy because what I have plan be go to make you beg I for the respite of a warm bed tell I where my friend be the Wizard be dead I kill he myself you be lie you 've never encounter a Mord Sith before have you we can capture and control any form of magic that be direct at we that be why your friend try to warn you not to use your Sword I turn its power against you and then I burn your friend to the ground with his own Wizard 's Fire do it upset you to learn this not really the old man be get on my nerve anyway now who be the liar those belong to the other man I 've train it be an honor to add the Sword of Truth to my collection I would not grow too fond of it if I be you it be just that sort of rebellious attitude that be make you something of a problem for Lord Rahl Rahl 's day be number he be go to kill you but now in his wisdom he see that this would only make you a martyr perhaps turn even more people to your misguided cause so instead he be give I the honor of train you no one be go to train I do you not feel my Agiel the hard you fight the more painful its magic will become and after I 've finish train you with it you will do anything to please I anything and nothing will please I more than to see the Seeker stand at the gate of the People 's Palace and there before the multitude take the hand of Lord Rahl and pledge his undying love and fealty to he I be go to take that Sword and I be go to kill he with it after I kill you I do enjoy a challenge shall we begin what be your business here I be look for a friend she live in the village this friend who be she my friend be very fond of white rose you be a friend of Lara 's welcome it be an honor to be ask but I do not know if I be ready to be confessor to the Seeker I have faith in you Lara you can do this I 've make so many friend here the villager the past few year they 've come to depend on I to guide they in their affair keep order I will give they whatever help they need then I would be honor to serve the Seeker save some rainwater I be Benedict why be they keep you prisoner my daughter I be asleep in my bed when those D'Haran animal break in they take I and my young Mariel she be only 8 she be here she be in another temple she be undergo the Trials if she live through they they will turn she into a Mord Sith but she be only a child that be how they create these monster they kidnap young girl from their family punish they mercilessly until there be not a shred of kindness leave in they then they teach they dark magic and how to use it to torture in the service of Darken Rahl my daughter 's final test will be to kill I to prove she be one of they maybe we both can not escape but if I can keep they busy you might have a chance you do not even know I why would you do this why do you give I your water when you have so little I know how difficult this be it be not easy for I either I consider all of you family but the Seeker need my help Kahlan have come to take care of you you will all honor and obey she as if she be I we will do as you say my Lady why be these people kneel before you you must tell the truth have you use your power to confess they I have confess they all you turn they into slave and command they to ignore their fear they drive the D'Harans out of the village I give they a purpose strength to defend their home rebuild their life and become your obedient servant I do not do this for myself I do it to help they be you sure no part of you enjoy make these people worship you do anything that you ask this man Raph have you take he as your lover and how many have you confess that be different I 've confess enemy in battle to protect the Seeker and his mission and only when it be absolutely necessary who be you to tell I what I do be not necessary I do what I think be right these people be safe now they be happy Lara it be all right he be a friend what be it what happen Richard 's be capture by the Mord Sith get up run go what be you wait for Mistress you do not really think Benedict would leave we do you we be practically family I would never betray you Mistress I tell he everything you say I should so everything you tell I about your daughter be a lie that be all true but now after be here with we these past few month Benedict realize what an honor it be to have his daughter choose to be Mord Sith do not you Benedict yes mistress you plan this why to show you the futility of try to resist I you surprise I Seeker you could have run might have even make it to the main gate but you give up your one chance at freedom all for a child you would never meet why to keep she from become like you Mord Sith will torture he within an inch of his life and when they be do he will do whatever they command lie murder they could turn he into a pawn of Darken Rahl Richard will resist he will fight the pain yes but their Agiels can break any man not even Richard can hold out against they I could not even try to defend he they would 've take my power and turn they against I and without my magic I be just an old man in a robe there must be a way to save he I follow the Mord Sith back to their temple there be dozen of D'Haran guard we do not have the man to overwhelm their defense I can get you the man absolutely not what do you mean no she be confess everyone in the village what you hear what the Mord Sith will do to the Seeker we will save he some other way what other way be there you ask I to take up your mission to protect the Seeker that be what I be offer to do you be offer not the people you would be order into battle they would have no choice if we have any chance of save Richard we have to go now I know what you be do try to use your mind to escape everybody try it but it will not work because even your thought belong to I can you tell what I be think now if I touch you here with the Agiel your heart will stop now tell I who be you with Rahl want I alive you say so yourself if you kill I imagine what he would do to you it be call the Breath of Life it be use to revive those who die during training I be dead for a few minute you be nearly a permanent resident of the underworld now you know not even death will end your torture the Agiel be so much more than a weapon when I stop your heart with it it leave a part of I here our heart our mind be become one soon your only thought will be how can I please my mistress then everything will be so much easy for you I will not have to hurt you anymore would you like that but first you have to tell I who be you think of her name be Kahlan Kahlan Amnell you be in love with she have she confess you be that why you love her Kahlan would never do anything to hurt I and she would never need magic to make I love she she do not tell you tell I what if you and Kahlan be to be together even once her power would be unleash it would overwhelm you and destroy your soul you would be her slave forever that be not true you never wonder why she do not return your feeling a noble brave young man like the Seeker so pleasing to the eye of any woman this be not right this can never be I can not believe your Wizard friend never warn you none of that boy it can never be not with her I do not want to see you suffer anymore I have other duty to attend today so Constance will be train you and she be very brutal so I want you to create a refuge in your mind as you do before but you tell I not to think of Kahlan I want you to think of I I do what you tell I I be not with her I be with you you do well but there be still a part of you that be defiant you be think if you grab my Agiel you might be able to fight your way out go ahead pick it up after withstand so much I will not deny you the chance I just want you to understand that an Agiel cause constant pain to anyone who it touch even the person who wield it well if it hurt you I be sorry do not be Pain be the one experience common to every live thing it unite we Mord Sith be teach to use pain to channel it control it just as you be learn the Mord Sith and the D'Harans be fearsome but their sword and dark magic can not break the love that bond we the battle tonight will be ours we will free the Seeker we will do as you bid my Lady I can not let these people be slaughter they will fight without fear the advantage be ours you be order they into battle against train D'Haran soldier and Mord Sith because they have no fear do not mean they will not be outmatch and kill when that happen any hope of save Richard die with they how else do we get Richard out if I can find a way to talk to Richard get through to he remind he that he be the Seeker maybe we can find a way out together and what if he be already break maybe I can get close enough to kill the Mord Sith who be be train he break her hold over he one hour that be all I ask if I do not come back by then may the spirit protect you child Mistress Denna would you allow Constance to train I tomorrow why be you ask for Constance you prefer her touch to mine obviously I 've be too easy on you why do you ask for her answer I because it hurt you to use the Agiel I do not want you to suffer any more because of I I 've never know anyone like you Seeker there be someone at the main gate send they away it be a confessor you must be Kahlan Richard 's tell I all about you apparently he be in love with you but not anymore I can see why you be not quite as impressive as I have imagine I have a hundred man in the hill ready for battle they be prepare to strike this temple my scout tell I that there be only two dozen man in the hill and they be not fighter they be common villager they be not common at all every one of they have be confess they will fight to the death to save the Seeker if they attack many will die maybe even you I want to avoid bloodshed I know how powerful you be all I ask be to talk to the Seeker alone to say goodbye my scout also observe another confessor on the hill and from what Richard have tell I about you you would never use your power to enslave innocent villager it must have be the other confessor so all I need to do be kill she and the spell on her follower would be break you make a wise choice Richard I be very proud of you I be sorry I do not want to hurt you but Denna 's archer would have kill you we have to get you out of here I do not know if I can leave I be lose myself to Denna I try to fight but her magic be too strong Most of the time I can not even think I do anything she ask I to you can resist she she be go to make I stand with Rahl and swear allegiance to he you would never do that I might do bad I can not defy she especially when she be near I with her Agiel if she order I to kill you I might not be able to stop myself I know you you be strong enough there might be a way tell I confess I Richard I can not confess you you have to I would destroy everything that you be Denna 's already do that if you confess I I can fight she I would rather be your slave than hers you can fight she without magic look inside yourself I have but when I do I do not see myself anymore I only see she please you have to Shota be right you have betray I I betray you by leave if I would have stay with you none of this would 've happen how much long Patience we give she what she ask for it be be an hour she be not come back I want you to take your man to the left after they my Lady do not be afraid where be you go the Seeker still need our help the Confessor be dead her poor slave have be free from bondage there be nobody leave to fight for you before you be execute you will be train by I rest assure your training will be slow and agonizing of course Richard can save you this torment by grant you a merciful death and prove to I once and for all that his training be complete kill she do it now do it now kill she Richard this be not you I can not then watch her suffer end her pain Richard how do you you teach I how to withstand pain we need to get you out of here there be something that I need to tell you Denna tell I be it true do you know what it be like hear it from her why do not you tell I I be afraid that if I tell you the truth you would become scared of I your feeling would change well why would you care if my feeling change you tell I you do not share they like you say I be not a very good liar so now what I be not sure but I do know I be not leave your side again what about the Prophecy I can not think of any bad betrayal than leave you maybe the Prophecy 's be fulfil but Richard your mission be far more important than any feeling we may have that be why we we can never act on they we can never let our guard down we have to bury they can you do that if there be one thing I learn from Denna it be how to suffer in silence Mistress Joyous news Lord Rahl the force you send to Kelabra have deliver the second Box of Orden send word to Queen Milena tell she that I accept all her demand in return for the third box forgive I Lord Rahl but why would we pay such a generous price when one division of our force could crush Queen Milena to dust once I have all three box the magic of Orden will give I

she try now push it be a boy what be wrong the child must die it be not your fault Dennee it be no one 's fault there be nothing you could 've do to prevent this Kahlan what be go on we be go to need Kreeg root for the ritual will someone tell I what be happen here Male Confessors can not be allow to live their soul must be purify by the Ritual of the Waters before they pass to the underworld ritual what be you talk about we have to drown the child that be insane a confessor give birth to a male child be extraordinarily rare but if one be bear he can not be allow to grow into adulthood Male Confessors be unable to control their power once they reach manhood they can not resist use it for wicked end so they be kill at birth your number be dwindle and now you want to kill one of your own just because you think it might be evil mother of male confessor have often think as you do one foolish young Confessor could not bear to have her son kill so she raise he in secrecy she think that the love in her heart would be powerful enough to prevent he from turn to the dark way but when the boy come of age his bloodlust be insatiable my child be only 11 year old when I have to kill he just because it happen with your son do not mean it be go to happen with Dennee 's he be just a baby there be still time to watch he grow to know if he be go to be evil or not you can not go along with this you think this be easy for I this be my nephew I know that be it be hard for you to understand but ancient way must be honor the long we allow this child to live the hard it be go to be to do what must be do do it now be a less cruel fate for both the family and the child Finn will take the child and perform the ritual of the Waters be there no other way you know there be not get away from he you can not wish evil away you can not love evil away you can only destroy it you be not go to hurt this baby D'Harans they be close we need to move now I can get the D'Harans off our trail but you have to promise I nobody will harm this baby while I be go Dala oil and Kreeg root the ritual of the Waters the Confessor give birth to a boy a female Confessor child be quite a prize but what Lord Rahl would not give for a male Confessor and if they be run from we they have not have time yet to perform the ritual their track lead this way follow they we must save that child do you lose they they find the track I leave they be head in the wrong direction but they be not go to give up so easily they know it be a boy and it seem Rahl really want to get his hand on a male confessor it be the darkness reach for the darkness but he will not have it where be the baby Finn 's take he you be suppose to keep he safe I be sorry you do not understand you be right I do not you promise I Cause I know you would do anything to protect the child and so should you Richard let he live would be a violation of everything we be teach you can not ask I to go against my belief and you can not ask I to go against mine do not I can not disobey my mistress you have to do what your mistress want right she want I to drown our son be you sure that be what Dennee want the Mother Confessor order she to do it do not your mistress also command you with her heart you hear she when she give birth she do not want her baby to die you know her heart well than anyone Finn you know what she want she want her baby to live I will protect he with my life you give the child to the Seeker I think that be what you would want no the child be evil and must die then I have fail you which way do the Seeker go to the north I can get he back you will go with Alana take Dennee and the other to the shore the Wizard Kahlan and I will continue after the child take Mira as your guide we will rejoin you at the shore once we have the child then we can complete the ritual and sail to the island Mother Confessor let I go on to track Richard I will move fast on my own we 've lose their trail they can not have get far and for your sake that child have well be alive when we find they it be okay we be safe now Everything be go to be all right stay away Kahlan Richard wait what be you plan on do just keep run with the child what your people want to do be barbaric I know it must seem that way but you have to understand that boy be a threat to everything that we be fight for how do you know that if none of they havelive it be too dangerous to rely on hope Hope be not that what we be fight for I be a child that be hunt Darken Rahl try to kill I because of his blind faith in prophecy be you ask I not to believe in prophecy I be ask you to believe in I he be hungry we need to find some food my father use to give this to I when I be a baby there you go I think you might like that what be we go to do with he well I be think we can take he to the Valley of Thandor the duty of the Sisters of the Light be to protect the child at Thandor they would never take in a male confessor no one will we be on our own you be never on your own Richard wait we do not need to fight amongst ourselves we have enough enemy already this baby be not one of they but he could be Darken Rahl be once a child think of all the death and suffer he be cause if you have a chance to prevent that would not you inevitably evil be in its nature well it be not in mine no one be go to hurt this baby enough debate Zeddicus if you can not control the Seeker I will be your devotion so great that you would threaten to confess the Seeker I have no intention of confess he command I Mother Confessor Zedd what have you do you have betray your order who be you to question my judgment when yours be so obviously impair by your feeling for the Seeker you would forsake everything you believe everything you 've live for for a man who can never love you Zeddicus get the boy Zedd you can not do this you do not want to hurt we it be no use Richard he be be confess he be not Zedd anymore I do not wanna fight you Zedd and he do not want to fight you give I the child and you can continue with your mission the mission you jeopardize that when you confess a Wizard of the First Order as soon as I have the child I will command Zeddicus to continue on as the Seeker 's Wizard all will be as it be very well make he leave Mother Confessor you be go to kill he this have go on long enough your mission be to protect the Seeker you know as well as I his life be more important than the child 's so give he to I it should not be a difficult decision save the man you love do not do it Kahlan it be okay little one it will all be over soon I be sorry I go against your will by try to save our child I fail you no you do not fail I you be do my will you can not put such idea in his head why not Mother Confessor know what must be do we can not defy she would you feel the same if it be your child it have be do this way for thousand of year there be only six of we leave do the ancient way still make sense I be so sorry but I could not let they hurt you it be not your fault with Zedd confess and the Sword of Truth go it be hopeless there be always hope we be too late be not we Mother Confessor have take the child to the shore to drown he can we catch she in time she be confess Zedd and take the Sword of Truth what be we go to do we be go to get some help the track end here where do he go I be right here I be unarmed then you be a fool Kahlan now command I confessor what be it Mother Confessor the other they should already be here Someone 's come stop they you will never know how greatly you 've disappoint I Kahlan I always think that one day you would be Mother Confessor how wrong I be you be teach all your life to know the difference between right and wrong this child could destroy everything we 've be fight for we be fight for a world with less brutality would kill that child give we that I be just glad I do not hurt you she dedicate her life to keep the Midlands free from the tyranny of Darken Rahl for that she will be remember spirit watch over she as she have watch over so many we need to choose a Mother Confessor we already have it be you Kahlan I be honor but I must continue to protect the Seeker just as we must stay here to protect the people from Rahl 's injustice take Mira she will keep you safe thank you for come back for I I ask the spirit to protect you and they do they will be fine you say it yourself Dennee and Finn can not be confess so their son 's touch will have no effect he can not be seduce by his own power if he be unable to use it once they reach Valeria there will not be anyone to corrupt with no one to corrupt he they can raise he to be a force for good but what if we be wrong what if we 've unleash a horrible evil into the world what then I be take breakfast to

see where he hide the box Childhood memory be easy Lord Rahl but a secret as important to the Seeker as where he have hide the box be sure to be lock away where even the Magic of Amberlis have to work hard to find it as for his love of his confessor he be a young man like any other surely there be a girl he leave behind some fresh faced maiden of the forest who can draw his thought away from Kahlan Amnell Anna what be you do here how do I come as soon as I hear South Haven to Hartland in two day let somebody try to beat that do you hate I for move away for never write I be angry for a long time

know what you be do the door must not be open who be you why do you attack we I come to steal treasure I do not believe the tale of evil spirit until I find myself possess by one that light that leave you it be a spirit who have own I for five long year he force I to attack you to keep you from open the door why this place be full of great evil get out get out while you still can we be deal with more than one spirit one lead we to this door the other try to kill we to keep we from open it it could be a way out Restless spirit be unpredictable I 've hear story of the spirit of mother lonely for their child lead they to their death but Viviane be a confessor even as a spirit she would never harm a Seeker we should open the door I do not know what choice do we have there be no other way out it be an ancient language the same as the Book of Counted Shadows it say here lie Kieran the True Seeker why would his body be hide away in a plain casket when a sacred crypt be build just for he we do not know for certain that his body be even in there let us find out Richard do not you do not know what be in there Someone 's cut off his head why this be a Wizard 's spell these magical binding keep the spirit from move to its final resting place in the underworld so he be never be reunite with his family his love one that must be why Viviane walk here that be why she be cry because her Seeker be trap here she can not be with he she be be wait for a thousand year to be reunite with he we may wait wither for the next thousand year if we do not find a way out I think this be our way out maybe Viviane trap we here because she want we to help Kieran and maybe once Kieran 's free she will free we too undo another Wizard 's magic be a violation so be behead a Seeker Kieran give up everything for his quest his spirit should be with his father his mother his confessor the people he love not trap here alone in the dark I agree it be terrible but wizard do not do thing like this lightly who know what will happen if we unbind he we can not leave he like this alone think of everything he be sacrifice I sincerely hope I do not end up regret this as I destroy these binding so shall the spirit be free as this cloth be consume by flame so shall the binding release can you hear I boy I be fine be you sure you be not hurt then let us see if that door be open not yet Kieran 's spirit be free but his body be still hide like something shameful we need to return he to the crypt when the road you walk be dark may you always see the light ahead may you always remember that you do not walk alone now that Kieran be lay to rest let we hope our task here be do lead the way what be you do it be not Richard anymore it be Kieran Fight this fight this spirit that possess you he can not hear you anymore Richard free your spirit and this be how you repay he I be take back what that Wizard Amfortas steal from I a thousand year ago what be you talk about he do not understand the bond between Confessor and Seeker and he betray I Viviane must leave we why there be too much between you I see it in your eye you love she we 've do nothing wrong yet I have watch the two of you grow close Viviane have become a distraction and it be put your quest in jeopardy I swear I will remain true to my quest but you must swear you will not send she away swear it I swear but Amfortas lie to I just as you lie to he I be a confessor I can see that you do love Viviane what if I do my feeling for Viviane be not go to keep I from my quest but Amfortas would not trust I Viviane Wait where be you go Amfortas think it be too dangerous for I to stay at your side how could he he swear he would not send you away he say you think more of I than you do of your quest we belong to each other we never can and you know why because your love would enslave I there be no harm you could do to I I would already do anything that you ask because I be already your to command she give in to her passion and you be confess she violate she most sacred duty to protect the Seeker our love only strengthen our bond but Amfortas think as you do and be determined to destroy we what you do be wrong what you be do now be wrong you have to release this Seeker release he why would I do that what good do it do you to possess his body when Viviane be only a spirit wait for you to join she in the underworld stay back you will not do anything to hurt I you hurt I you hurt your Seeker I have no intention of join Viviane in the underworld I have a body now once I finish with this Grace Viviane will have a body too yours stay back creature or I will blast you back to whatever dark hole you come from if you do that you your Seeker and your confessor will be trap in this tomb for all eternity who be you I be the spirit of Amfortas Wizard to Kieran though your Seeker kill this body I 've use an ancient spell of awakening to occupy it once more but I only have a thousand heartbeat before it die again so listen to I can you open this door not until you listen to I I be the one that try to stop you from unbind Kieran 's body why because the story you know of Kieran be a lie how do you come to learn this magic maybe you do not know as much about Seekers as you think one thousand year ago Kieran and Viviane do the bad thing a Seeker and a confessor could do they consummate their love and it ruin Kieran he let Count Alrawn his great foe slip through his finger because he think only of protect Viviane I need to protect my Seeker my confessor now open this door you must listen to I I go to Viviane and make it clear she have a terrible decision to make he be unsure in battle he think of nothing but you you must release he you know what you be ask there be only one way to release a confessed man the Seeker can not fulfill his destiny as long as you be alive and she defy you the Seeker remain confessed and fail his quest because of it Viviane know her duty Viviane where be you Viviane what have you do what I have to Kieran I will wait for you in the underworld you can not leave I you have betray I Amfortas I will never stop love Viviane or hate you I have never see a look full of such loathing but we have a quest to complete I think once Kieran be no long under Viviane 's control his grief would fade and he would come back to himself but he do not a normal man free from his Confessor would return to his former as if nothing happen but a Seeker and a confessor have a special bond it be strong than even I could fathom and even Viviane 's death could not break it it be as if Kieran 's soul have be tear from he leave nothing but anger and hate when he take up the Sword again the Sword of Truth feed on rage it make his anger grow it overtake he it drive he mad these people be not soldier you have betray innocent this world have no innocent you have betray your quest you have tarnish the name of Seeker and you take everything from I Viviane and I will not be keep apart even if you kill I you will not stop I I must I will I fear Kieran 's vow that he would not rest even in death I realize he might prey on the spirit of the underworld destroy the peace they would find in life so I have to bind his spirit if you have allow his spirit to reunite with Viviane 's then Kieran would have find peace and none of this would be happen if you have not unbind Kieran Kieran would not be try to reunite with Viviane now in the flesh my love he be use Kahlan 's body as a vessel Richard will be confess he will become a monster just like Kieran finally what the Wizard steal from we be ours forever I have enough power leave to cast a spell that will keep he here in the crypt forever you can not do that without the Seeker Darken Rahl will conquer the world thousand will die and how many will die if Kieran 's wrath be unleash upon the world again then let I into the tomb I will drive Kieran 's spirit from Richard 's body and if you can not be you willing to kill your Seeker this be wrong we can not do this we sacrifice our love once we deserve to be happy together you say you would wait for I and you do we be finally together we can not throw this chance away Richard be more than just the Seeker to I as be Kieran to I I love he protect he teach he so I hesitate Cause I love he that hesitation lead not only to the loss of innocent life it lead to the loss of Kieran 's soul too you lead a Wizard to my hiding place where Amfortas have bind I why would you do that if you do not want we to be together I only do that so that he would free your spirit so we could be together in the underworld our love be beyond flesh that be a lie that the Wizard tell we so we would be content live without something everyone else take for grant but this confessor this Seeker they have a destiny too a destiny that be destroy they just as it do we they love each other I know you can f this will be a way for they to be together too I 've want to touch you for so long and I 've miss you so much this be all that matter we be all that matter if you tell I you do not love I I will release you tell I you do not love I that you do not want I I can not tell you that the door to the outside world be open if you be not willing to do your duty Wizard then leave I will do my duty as First Wizard now let I in you say you could open it this body be weaken I be not strong enough maybe if you join I remember what happen to Kieran Death be not the bad fate that can befall a Seeker stay away Wizard your Seeker and Confessor be go stop what be you do this time the story be go to end the way it be suppose to I will not let you kill he do not make this Seeker lose everything for a love that be not even his and what about my love for Kieran go back to the underworld and let Kieran follow you there I trust Amfortas and I 've wait in the underworld for a thousand year alone that will not happen this time you will bind he again and we will never be together I leave he once I will never leave he again Amfortas be right about one thing a confessor can be replace the Seeker can not stop it what be you do I will do anything to protect the Seeker include kill his confessor I will drive Viviane from this body and I will bind her spirit so that you will never meet again in this world or the next please then leave Richard 's body and I will allow Viviane to follow you to the underworld why should I believe you because I be not Amfortas I believe a Seeker and a Confessor belong together in the underworld you and Viviane can exist in peace but you can not be together here your only choice be to trust I Seeker then this time Viviane it be I who will be wait for you in the underworld you be free Viviane go find he thank you well obviously we can not leave the box in this curse place the story of Viviane and Kieran the one that be in the book it be be hand down for a thousand year pass off as truth maybe it be a necessary lie People need a hero so the legend can be preserve no matter what the truth be I will not judge Amfortas for change the story it be a great responsibility to name a Seeker one mistake can send he spiral into darkness when Kieran possess I I sense that darkness and there be something else something I 've never feel before a power magical power Kieran have magic strong enough to draw a Grace how could he do that it be Rahl I do not understand it be a tracer cloud powerful magic he be track we I do not think it be we he be focus on it be the Box of Orden I will cast a spell of obscure follow the box will not be such an easy task for he now where will we take it not we I you can not go off on your own I will not allow the box to be the beacon that lead Rahl to Richard I will rejoin you once I hide it where it be safe if only I know the answer to that I will find you once the box be hide I do not need to tell you both be careful I do not like it when Zedd go off by himself he be willing to take the risk for the sake of your quest in the crypt he be ready to sacrifice you he be just do what he have to to keep we from become like Viviane and Kieran that will not happen they probably think the same thing but in that moment of weakness they lose everything well we be strong than they be I hope you be right love be not something to fear for I it be Richard he be fine who what be you talk about you can not hide anything from I there be nothing to worry about trust I do you know where Zedd go he tell you where he be hide the Box of Orden do not he I can not believe he would trust you and not I I have no idea where Zedd be you enjoy that do not you come on stop who be you and why be you follow we Chase what be you do here I will explain everything but there be a D'Haran quad on my tail I have a feeling they consider the Seeker a big prize than I 1x14 Hartland he be dead Chase stop it be okay well now maybe you can tell we what you be do in the Midlands I 've be in a D'Haran labor camp you remember that dragon the one that try to kill my daughter Laura the Gar after the Boundary be open dozen of those beast swarm into Hartland they slaughter livestock child I have to do something so I go to see your brother what be you do here Chase if I be to save this village I need every able bodied man back under my command you be not the captain of the Guard anymore you lose that honor when you side with my brother there be monster out there kill our people Citizens that you as First Councilor be swear to protect now let I do my job this time your brother do the right thing but when we reach the Boundary it be not just Gars we have to deal with a battalion of D'Harans be come in we try to fight but they they kill most of my man and clap I in iron those D'Harans they know how to break a man 's spirit I almost give up but a few day ago they bring in another prisoner tell tale of the Seeker he have hear you be nearby that my friend Richard Cypher have the D'Harans on the run you do not know the strength that give I the hope Next chance I get I make a run for it but I know they would send a quad after I and I be in no shape to stay ahead of they for long so I came look for you I can not thank you enough now if you can spare a horse and some food Chase what be you talk about you be with we now I got to get back to Hartland I get to find my family then we be come with you but Darken Rahl be in the opposite direction Kahlan 's right you have a big fight my friend I 've see what Rahl 's force can do to people if I can not protect my own village what kind of a Seeker be I both of you be want man if we be go to do this you should dress appropriately so how do we get past they we have these uniform maybe we can just walk through if they start ask question I know how we can get across your order sir do you recognize this Dragon Corps no member of the Corps answer to a foot soldier now move I be sorry sir no one may pass without proper document by order of the viceroy Funny you should mention the viceroy Guess who we be deliver this little lovely to if you turn we away he be go to demand to know who disrupt his entertainment plan let they pass Emma Emma Laura no one be be here in a while if those bastard have do anything to my family we will go into town we will find someone who know where they be they be D'Harans everywhere they 've take over Anna who be she

you expect I to believe those butcher be interested in my family I do not know where they be I swear it look at I he be tell the truth of course I be the D'Harans save Hartland Saved how Lord Rahl send his sorcerer to seal the Boundary to protect we from the Gars and the other magic that be come through but they could not close it again Lord Rahl send soldier to protect we the D'Harans be liar and murder you really believe they be here for the good of Hartland the Gars be no long kill our people our village be safe prosperous and we have Lord Rahl to thank for that I imagine you have a lot to thank Lord Rahl for so who do you take order from in exchange for all this safety and prosperity the viceroy Viceroy the Gar attack have alarm the villager More be ask to be move away from the Boundary do as they ask Sir why do we coddle these people Hearts and mind lieutenant our army be stretch thin we can not subjugate every village in the three territory by force so if Lord Rahl 's empire be to expand he must be a friend to the people now if that be all I have a personal matter to attend to sorry I be late I bring you a little something Anna thank you I guess thing around here have change more than we think I invite you here for a meal some conversation I think maybe you have the wrong impression of I I can not help myself when I be around you if I do not know well I would say you have put I under an enchantment do clever word like those make other girl swoon there be no other you expect I to believe that a dash brilliant man like you have no prospect other than a simple girl from Hartland Simple be not a word I would use to describe you be we just go to wait out here all night look this can not be easy for you know what be probably happen but if we force our way in Anna could get hurt be there any news of my brother I 've get every available man search for he I will find he I promise I be go to take care of you this be not your home someday you will have to leave be that what be bother you I 've request permanent assignment as Lord Rahl 's envoy in Hartland I 've fall in love with this charming village just as I be fall in love with you be you all right too much wine sit down we can not just stand here Chase I do not believe it what be you do here I hear be you we be just try not to be recognize I do not understand we do not have a lot of time we know the viceroy 's in there have you be spy on I Richard it be not what you think you do not owe I an explanation but these D'Harans be dangerous you can not trust that man I know that be why I 've be try to get close to he my brother 's miss he have not be see in month rumor be the D'Harans be kidnap people force they to serve in Darken Rahl 's army Chase 's family be miss too I be sorry what would their army want with my wife and child Anna you should probably go we be go to speak to the viceroy and it be well if you be not around you can not I sprinkle Rama leaf into his wine he will be out for at least two hour but I do have this a key to the safe in the viceroy 's chamber if the D'Harans do have something to do with all this the answer may be in there Chase will warn we if anyone come along but we would well hurry when I come back to Hartland I look for you they tell I you would fall under the spell of a witch kill your father and go to the Midlands Anna that be not true do you remember when we be little and you think you see a tree goblin behind your house I tell the constable we both see it do you know why because I believe you just like I will believe you now if you tell I what really happen I go to the Midlands because of a thousand year old prophecy it say I be destine to kill Darken Rahl and free the world from his tyranny sound ridiculous do not it I always have a feeling you be mean for big thing maybe that be why I move away something tell I you be go to leave Hartland so I leave before I get my heart break over here it be a record book Troop deployment supply request Transport order there be a list of name there be your brother so the D'Harans do take he do it say where Northwood Grove it be only a few league from Hartland he be take there two month ago all of these people be send there that do not make any sense there be nothing in that grove what about Chase 's family they be not here why would the D'Harans send my brother to a grove in the middle of nowhere we be too late he be go they be feed people to the Gars you know my brother be a good man until you put he under your spell you may have grow up with Richard but you do not know the first thing about he he be not under anyone 's spell and to the people of the Midlands he be a hero Richard Cypher a hero this be what your D'Haran friend be do to your people I do not understand do not play stupid bastard do you feed my family to the Gars what be you talk about the D'Harans protect we from the Gars that be what they want you to think the Gar attack in the square when the soldier shoot it out of the sky I think it be stage stage they have Gars chain outside town when anyone question why the D'Harans be here they release one of the Gars their soldier kill it in front of witness Michael declare the D'Harans hero and everyone pledge their allegiance to Rahl this be your seal be not it Office of the First Council you give the D'Harans these name why they want volunteer man to enlist in their army the viceroy ask I for the name of those who do not wanna join People like my brother so they send he to the Grove to be feed to the Gars along with all the other the viceroy tell I that they would find other way for the people to be useful they find another way they tell I Hartland have to do its part for the D'Haran cause I think I be keep the town safe I do not know do not know or do not want to know I wanna help you stop they how every evening I lead the town in prayer instead I could tell people the truth I be still First Councilor they will listen to I and they will rise up there be one problem the viceroy stand with I during the prayer once he realize what you be do he will have you kill not if I distract he distract he how I could visit the viceroy in his chamber keep he there while Michael make his speech how many more people be go to die if we do not stop they there be soldier in the square what if they try and stop the speech we will be there to assure they do not and if Michael point out the Seeker to the guard instead we will just have to trust he I admire her spirit she be always have a mind of her own how long be the two of you we be always close since we be crawl on all four after Darken Rahl be defeat maybe you could come back and you and Anna could pick up where you leave off why be we talk about this because you deserve a normal life a wife a family would not be fair to Anna why not how could I marry she when my heart belong to somebody else wait outside I do not expect to see you I think I would surprise you you be go when I wake up my niece be ill and you be so tired I do not wanna wake you I owe you an apology I 've be push you away the truth be I have feeling for you too I be just afraid you be go to leave but now that you be stay I do not wanna keep you wait anymore I have to go please stay with I I can not but I will be back Anna what be you do guard why you kill my brother how many people do you feed to those monster how many and I actually think we have a future People of Hartland I have something very important to talk about this evening be there a problem then begin the invocation People of Hartland let we pray Master Rahl guide we Master Rahl teach we Master Rahl protect we in your light we thrive in your mercy we be shelter where 's Anna they 've take she where Northwood Grove it be the Seeker it be all right Viceroy the prisoner 's be rescue by a man wield the Sword of Truth do you know your brother be in Hartland of course not Richard Cypher 's a traitor to my family he be no brother to I Lord Rahl anticipate the Seeker might return home you know what your order be what order you have to leave now leave why they lie to I from the beginning they never try to close the Boundary they been use magic to keep it open how the arch they build at the border it have magical property it be keep the passage from close up the viceroy be on his way to destroy the arch he say the Boundary will then seal itself they will cut off the only route to here defeat the Seeker be more important they wanna trap you on this side of the border because if you can not return to the Midlands you will never be able to defeat Darken Rahl Viceroy a rider approach First Councilor do not do this Hartland need the Boundary open you know very well I have order from Lord Rahl you would be cut off our only trade route with the Midlands think of your man all of you will be trap on this side of the Boundary a sacrifice we be willing to make to defeat the Seeker I be not Councilor do not make the same mistake your brother do one man can not defy Lord Rahl you be right we will get you to a healer it be too late stay with I when I see our father in the underworld I will tell he my brother be a great hero you will order the Gars destroy and disband all D'Haran force in Hartland once I 've leave you will obey Anna 's command as if they be my own do you understand I will do as you bid my Lady I wish I could control man like that he have to tell the truth be not that right my family be take by your man where be they I be order to gather woman child and send they to the Keep of Edraan it be in the Midlands you 've hear of this place only in rumor the Keep be protect by dark and powerful magic why be they send there I do not know we will find your family I promise even if we do Rahl will keep send soldier across the Boundary to kill more people then I guess we be go to have to do what he want close the Boundary you will set the charge and destroy the arch once Richard Chase and I be on the Midlands side after we fight so hard to keep the D'Harans from close it I would ask you to stay but I know you have a big destiny and other people who need you there be something else very important I need you to do it be an urgent message from the high viceroy in Hartland what do the viceroy report Lord Rahl I have the most glorious news in accordance with your stand order the Boundary have be seal as for the Seeker what of the Seeker my Lord be this message authentic it be in the viceroy 's hand I be certain of it my Lord you 've succeed the Seeker be dead now there be really no go home again I be sorry about Michael we should get move before the D'Harans send troop to inspect their handiwork if we run into they get an extra pair of hand to fight they with now why have you be unable to locate the third Box of Orden or the Wizard Zeddicus the tracer cloud our sorcerer send out have be unsuccessful in find either my Lord but we be redouble our effort the Wizard will not evade we much long Lord Rahl think of what you 've accomplish even without all three box you 've conquer two territory and the resistance will soon be crush I do not want to crush they Egremont the Seeker have poison the mind of the people with this misguided notion that I want to do they harm when all I want to do be bring they peace at least my Lord can take comfort in the news that the Seeker no long stand in our way tell I Egremont do you really believe the Seeker be dead you be alive thank the spirit Messengers have be spread word that you abandon your quest flee back across the Boundary and die there we want he to believe that so he will let his guard down stop hunt I at least for a while we know we could trust you of course anything for the Seeker we be head for the Keep of Edraan can you take we there the Keep of Edraan that be a place most people would do anything to avoid we do not have that luxury my family be abduct in Hartland send there as prisoner I be sorry to hear that they will not be prisoner much long it will not be easy get in will not be easy for those D'Haran bastard to keep I out we could take that patrol storm the place Easy Chase we do not wanna rattle the hive until we deal with the hornet inside what exactly go on in there no one really know that be why I have you assign here Bram so you could witness Giller 's twisted alchemy for yourself I would hope your account of what go on here be exaggerate Uncle but that woman that woman be one of the lucky one at least she die and the more Rahl push Giller for result the more sadistic his experiment become for too long I 've sit idly by while Rahl have wage his war in the name of peace and now I be suppose to watch as he have his Wizard butcher defenseless woman and child Lord Rahl must have his reason if Giller succeed Rahl will no long need the Boxes of Orden to control we all we will all be enslave to his will Captain Ericon Inform Lord Rahl that we be make progress despite today 's disappointment yes Wizard we be run out of place to bury Giller 's disappointment you be right this be madness but defy Rahl be just as insane if we do not act soon defy Rahl will no long be an option Lord Rahl word from Edraan it appear Wizard Giller might have more success if he have the proper motivation send a reply my dear Giller what be it when the Constellation of Pirion align Lord Rahl will arrive at the Keep he be come to oversee Giller 's work personally and when he get here we be go to kill he command I confessor the prisoner ar a dungeon just below the Keep be my family among they be they all right I do not know there be many woman and child hold inside the only time I 've see the prisoner be when their body be take out to be bury if anything be happen we be go to get they out some of my man in the resistance intercept a shipment of Dragon 's Breath last week you think we could blast our way into the Keep there be enough to blast it back to D'Hara we might end up kill the prisoner then how the Keep do not even have window without window how be it light oil lamp feed through pipe from a cistern cut off the flow of oil would plunge the keep into darkness can not stop we free the prisoner if they can not see we do it some of my man be ready to act but we need you you grow up with Rahl you be his old friend the abuse inflict upon I be not act of friendship Rahl trust you and when he arrive he will grant you a private audience he clearly have a special place in his heart for you Rahl have no heart of course he do and when he embrace you you will plunge your dagger into it that be suicide Rahl 's guard will be just outside the door my man and I will kill the guard while you be inside what about Giller we will kill the Wizard blame he for the assassination no one will question it remember Giller once swear allegiance to the Confessors and now keep the entrance cover think of your son when he come of age he will be conscript be you willing to sacrifice he for this pointless brutal war I be not I be with you Uncle Emma Laura who be there thank the spirit I 've find you Chase I do not believe it Father we be go to get you out of here all of you but you have to follow our footstep and stay very quiet I want that leak repair we be try to relight the lamp check the dungeon they 've go all of they Lord Rahl arrive tomorrow I can try to delay his visit but if we have nothing to show he our blood will be use as ink for his Journey Book the prisoner can not have go far then find they we can rest here for a moment I miss you all so much every day I pray to see you again I be afraid I would never see you again nothing could stop I from find you Father what be wrong his heartbeat 's weak and he be burn up but he be still alive it be the Wizard 's do he perform dark magic on my mother and many of the other do I do this to Chase I do not know all I do be kiss he this Wizard do you know his name they call he Giller you 've hear of he he use to serve the Confessors until he sell his service to Rahl what do he do to you what be that some kind of magic I 've never see it before please you 've get to help my husband there be a healer half a day 's ride to the east that be head right back towards the D'Harans we have to risk it Chase could die without help track close to the river the prisoner will need a water source if you be opposed to Giller 's experiment should not we let the prisoner remain free without those prisoner Rahl will have no reason to journey to Edraan our plan depend on their recapture maybe you should not touch he at least until we know exactly what Giller do to you I pray to the spirit every day that I would see Chase again and now I can not even comfort he I know how hard this be Emma be there anything we can do hopefully this healer will be able to help Chase and will he be able to do anything for I will I be able to hold the man that I love again to kiss he again stop what be it we be not alone be you sure get they out of here the D'Harans be close get they the Seeker we be on your side you fool you just kill the man who be go to kill Darken Rahl Lord Rahl we 've receive word from the Wizard Giller he wish you to delay your journey to the Keep he would like more time he be have enough time tell he I will be arrive as plan Rahl 's come here Tonight when the Constellation of Pirion reach full alignment Rahl will arrive at the Keep where he would have be greet by my nephew with a dagger to his chest I believe he be tell the truth what be so important that would cause Rahl to come Rahl think Giller be on the verge of succeed at what make a confessor that be what he be try to do with Emma A Confessor 's power come from love when Emma kiss Chase she unleash it but she do not Confess Chase she nearly kill he Giller have not succeed in create a confessor only aberration how be that possible Giller 's uncover the ancient magic that be use to create the first confessor the Shurkia the Shurkia be magical tool of immense power Rahl have grow increasingly impatient if he can not have the three Boxes he want the power of a Confessor and now that Giller have the Shurkia Rahl will soon have that power he will be able to bend anyone to his will with a single touch and his dominion over this world will be complete because when Rahl arrive I will be wait for he you can get I inside the Keep and I will kill he and you would fulfill the Prophecy you will not be able to get near he he be too well guard the one man who could have get close enough to kill he be my nephew and our good chance die with he maybe we do not have to get close to Rahl to kill he Devlin say the resistance have capture some Dragon 's Breath enough to bring down the Keep you two can smuggle the Dragon 's Breath inside and once Rahl arrive we destroy the Keep along with Rahl Giller and the magic use to create the Confessors we need Giller alive if he use the Shurkia to put magic into Emma he might be the only one who can take it out well if we can get you inside close enough to confess Giller then we can get he out before we turn the keep into rubble there be only one problem Giller order I not to return without the escape prisoner if Giller want prisoner we will just have to give he some while we be go Devlin will try to find a healer and come back for Chase I be come with you one prisoner will not fool Giller you need a prisoner that he know I be come too you can not go back there we have to it be the only way you can not trust that D'Haran with the life of my family Kahlan will be there to protect they Richard please you risk everything to save this family now it be our turn I 've bring you your prisoner where be the rest of they they scatter like rat but my man will find they I do not remember this one what be your name your power will not work on I Confessor be you all right take he I be sorry I do not know she be a confessor she must have infiltrate the prisoner or she confess you if I be confess I would be defend her life right now your incompetence have provide I with an unexpected opportunity with a live confessor there will be no more fail experiment I can finally give Lord Rahl what he truly want you be only go to hurt yourself I could not have my creation turn against I so I devise an elixir to protect I from the Confessor 's touch that be impossible not with the Shurkia we would assume they have be lose forever but the shepherd boy chase of one his flock into the cave of Caddock and uncover the secret rest place of the great tool in all of alchemy when word reach I of this incredible find I have to have they for myself with the Shurkia I 've be able to combine magic in way I never imagine to do thing not do for 3000 year wondrous thing like create a protection from your Confessor power a power I will soon be able to harness and then at last confessor will be just a memory you be play with ancient power that you do not understand I 've see your creation prisoner infect with dark magic that will soon change thank to those D'Haran butcher I 've only be able study the body of dead confessor but now but now I can use the Shurkia to harvest your power and bestow they on Lord Rahl where be the other where be Kahlan Giller have they what the Wizard be unaffected by the Confessor 's touch that be impossible I see it with my own eye it be more of Giller 's magic your friend be his prisoner now we have to get they out of there that be suicide the constellation have almost align Rahl will be here at any moment which be why we have to go now it be too late for that the charge be be set we have to stop it you be the Seeker it be your destiny to kill Darken Rahl I will not sacrifice my friend to do it I already sacrifice my nephew and my man be their life worth any less the Confessor would want you to do it you know she would get out of my way it be time my Lord I be so glad you be here my Lord I have something very special to show you the Seeker live a capture confessor be quite a prize Giller yes my Lord so your elixir work her magic have no effect on I you have make more progress than I think Giller and you be certain the Shurkia can harvest the Confessor 's power soon her power will be yours my Lord the Seeker be alive and inside the Keep we have to get out of here but I be suppose to set off the Dragon 's Breath Kahlan tell I Kahlan 's be capture she be still here we just save her life and apparently you just save mine twice now I 've be tell you be dead yet here you be this be quite an honor it be not every day I get to meet the Seeker it be not every day I get to fulfill the Prophecy it will take more than Prophecy to defeat I I know how this must pain you both greatly see the one you love in such misery almost as painful as share an undying love which you can never consummate and what would you know about love except that you will never feel it from anyone it be such a pity you never have a potion such as this so that you could feel the soft touch of your lover 's caress her tender passionate embrace be unable to express your love for each other such a fate be unimaginable but when we be finish your touch will no long be a threat to anyone you have carry the burden of your power for so long Kahlan I be go to lift that burden and take it upon myself I will not need my power to see through your lie Kahlan if you can really see the truth you would know that all I want to do be end my people 's suffering and when I have the power of Confession there will be no more war no more strife only harmony and true last peace you will not succeed the people will rise up I may be dead but another Seeker will take my place and destroy you why kill you when I can turn the Seeker into a devoted servant you will be the first one I Confess what be it Giller I do not know my Lord the blood rage run my Lord kill she kill he kill he release the Seeker it be I be you all right yeah I think so what be that we have to get Emma and Laura out of here come on it be Giller 's potion there be only one leave you realize what we could do with this the magic be destroy so we can not undo what be do to Emma this potion will allow you to be with she without fear for touch thank you I can never thank you enough I be just happy to see you all together as a family again I hear what Darken Rahl say so I know what you give up when you give the potion to Chase but maybe someday you will find a way to be together I do not know how to thank you you should know by now you do not have to Darken Rahl know you be alive now you be go to need I with you go with Devlin the resistance could use your help and this will give you a chance to be a husband and a father again when the time come I will know where to find you it be a honor to fight alongside the Seeker the honor be all mine some friend of our pass I a message for you when I go to get the healer from a Ruben Rybnik the weather have not improve when it do I will seek the company of dear friend in the wood tomorrow I have news my Lord our sorcerer have discover that the Wizard Zeddicus be use an obscure spell to mask our tracer cloud no more excuse Egremont find the Wizard and bring I the Box the weather have not improve Zedd must not have be able to get away from Rahl 's tracer cloud when it do I will seek the comfort of dear friend in the wood tomorrow well he want we to meet he in a forest but where and it must be close if he expect we to join he tomorrow maybe it be not about when but where the Morrow Woods where be that in D'Hara we have a long journey ahead of we we can stop if you be tired you must be exhaust after what Giller 's magic do to you I be not so sure it be just Giller 's magic what do you mean there be a legend of an ancient magic possess only by the most powerful confessor it be an uncontrollable force know as Con Dar the blood Rage why do it happen maybe it be because of something that Giller do to I or maybe it be because of you I be so afraid that you would become Rahl 's slave and your mission would fail I could not let that happen whatever you do whatever it be you save we both if you have not try to save I Darken Rahl would be dead right now you have the chance to kill he but you risk everything for something that can never be Rahl be wrong when he say our fate be unimaginable the only unimaginable fate be one without you and he be wrong about something else too I will fulfill the Prophecy I be go to kill Rahl and I be go to do it with you by my side my Lord we 've do it we 've locate the Third Box of Orden where the tracer cloud have come to rest over the Plains of Morrow so close to the People 's Palace the Wizard be be brazen perhaps it be some kind of ploy no doubt Zeddicus be use magic to protect the box somehow send a battalion to the Plains of Morrow tell they to find the box at any cost yes my Lord at once Egremont do you remember your D'Haran history my Lord the Battle of the Plains of Morrow turning point in the Great Wizard War 3 000 year ago I study it in my youth my Lord but do you know why to this day the grass on the Plains of Morrow be always green in all season through blizzard and drought because it grow in the bone and blood of the Wizards massacre in the battle Zeddicus must be use their magic to shield the box somehow whoever find the Box of Orden will be honor and reward by Lord Rahl himself would anyone else like to walk away from their duty find the Box of Orden for Darken Rahl and for D'Hara 1x16 Bloodline what be you do well I think you want I to keep you sharp I do not say kill I if I get that close to kill you apparently you need the practice I leave for a fortnight and you two be at each other 's throat one more day and we be go to come look for you where have you be Disposing of the box which be at long last safely hide where under Rahl 's nose surround by seven concentric wall of lethal magic eventually his lordship will run out of man to fle against my fortification and go after the box himself and when he do he will wish he have not my Lord why do you make I hurt you like this I be sorry I fail you my Lord so you have claim too many time the fact remain you let the Seeker slip from your grasp I deserve my punishment and more release I and I will show you such pleasure that all will be forgive Pleasure alas must wait I have learn the exact location of the Third Box of Orden but my man have fail to retrieve it send I I will succeed I should never have send man to do a Mord Sith 's job but you would not want to disappoint I again Denna I will return with the box but you will not be able to do it alone First you need to capture the one person that I fear most in all the world the Seeker will not escape I again someone far more fearsome than he Mother hello Jennsen I be sorry I have to hurt your mother but I be here on extremely important business important to the peace and the happiness of the whole world and I need to be sure that I can count on your help let she go please First I need you to do something for I and for Lord Rahl Jennsen no whatever she ask do not I really hope you will not make I kill your mother Jennsen Somewhere in this field be a jeweled box find it why do I need a shovel you can see it the Wizard make it invisible it be be right here all along bring it to I these man what happen to they kill by the Wizard 's magic when they try to retrieve the box then how be I suppose to get it you never tell she tell I what forgive I Jennsen I be hope you would never have to know allow I Jennsen to be the one to show you how very far from ordinary you really be once every generation or so a child be bear upon whom magic have no effect whatsoever you be a very special girl Jennsen now get I the box let my mother go when she have a head start I will give you the box do you think you be in a position to negotiate with I take it please I be sorry what be that a magical alarm in case someone somehow manage to get the box how could anyone have break through your magic Brilliant the Wizard put a signal spell on it no doubt he be already race this way with the Seeker and the Confessor I do what you want please let we go I can not let you go Jennsen I need you to carry that box to the People 's Palace yourself I can not get it there safely without you do not help she let she kill I look at they Jennsen Look do the Wizard give a thought to the innocent man he would brutally slaughter to their fatherless child he think only of protect the treasure which he steal from Darken Rahl who seek only to spread peace throughout the Midlands she be lie to you ask yourself Jennsen which of we be really the liar here why have your mother hide your power from you all these year why have she hide you like some dirty shameful secret Darken Rahl have dream of universal peace ever since he be a little boy but now the Seeker have return to the Midlands and be relentlessly try to destroy that dream you never tell I any of this but Lord Rahl know that the Seeker be only a puppet dancing on string jerk this way and that by a Wizard in his wisdom and his mercy Lord Rahl send I to offer the Seeker a chance to stand at his side and declare peace throughout the territory and do you know how the Seeker greet this offer he run I through with the Sword of Lies and leave I for dead you tell I the Seeker be a hero he be a hero why do you lie to I about who I be you 've see what a monster this woman be how can you believe one word she say I do not know who the monster be I do not know anything anymore Jennsen get it back there I underestimate you Jennsen but not as tragically as you have underestimate I please stop I be the one who throw the box punish I Denna she be alive she be hold the Agiel it be not hurt she how can she do because she be pristinely ungifted stay back that be the other side of your gift not only can not you be harm by magic but you can not use it either you have a lot to learn about yourself the pristinely ungifted be entirely immune to magic but they rarely survive past childhood why not for generation the House of Rahl have find they and murder they at birth why because Rahl 's magic can not hurt they or enslave they what would be more dangerous to he Mistress I have the box now bind her hand to it and bind they both to the horse and hurry if the Wizard and his friend have not already find we they soon will defend the box you look like you 've see a ghost Run Taralyn let I go I have to help my mother we will we will as soon as we get the box as far away from Denna as we can if it will save my mother I will give it to she if Darken Rahl get this box we will all be slave everybody in the world and your mother would be as good as dead anyway I do not even know you why should I listen to you because he be the Seeker if you be the Seeker then that woman Denna be torture be your mother too I be bear three year after the massacre at Brennidon my mother oour mother hold I in her arm for eight day after I be bear because she be afraid I would be take away from she like you be she be still afraid to let I out of her sight every year she light candle for your birthday imagine what you look like how tall you be if you have freckle Zedd you know my mother could it really be her then then what I be not here to fight I be here to deliver a message from Mistress Denna she hold the girl 's mother at the Cave of Sorrows you bring the box or she die you have until nightfall we have to go now I be sorry child but we can not forfeit the final Box of Orden for one person 's life that be easy for you to say she be not your mother she be my daughter I be your grandfather and apparently yours as well child all this time and you never tell I I be afraid you might have to choose between the mission and family I never want to put you in that position do you know I want to tell you I ask she not to what be I to you two just a pair of hand to hold the Sword of Truth and fulfill your precious Prophecy who be our father I do not know I do not even know if we have the same one every time I try to talk about it Mother get so angry or sad so I finally stop ask I be go after her Richard wait for what there be no time I will give Denna the box I will get Taralyn safe then I will follow Denna get the box back before she deliver it to Rahl and if you do not catch she in time how can you just stand there and let your own daughter be torture by a Mord Sith your mother give up her first bear child for a reason she know that you be bear to stop Rahl from enslave the world she know that you have to survive no matter what if you let Rahl get the box then your mother 's sacrifice will have be for nothing that be not go to happen I can not let you leave with the box what be you go to do cook I with Wizard 's Fire I would never hurt you I be just go to stop you come on you can not stop Richard if I be with he can you you can come with we or you can stay either way we be go to save our mother be you all right here it be sprain you be not go anywhere until I bind it let I help your magic can not heal she she must think she grandfather a cold hearted bastard Someday she will understand what if there be no someday Kahlan you have to convince Richard to stop this madness you be the one who be always say we have to trust the Seeker 's instinct this be different this be his mother when he see she be torture I fear he be go to throw the box to Denna just to make she stop be you worried that Richard be go to do that or that you be Denna 's go to be ready for we she be go to have more soldier how can we fight she over the past few month I 've be attack by fly monster track by bounty hunter torture by Denna and beat bloody by Darken Rahl himself and I be still here all in one piece I think I see it now what when you smile right around the eye you look just like our mother try that if the box can do what you say give Darken Rahl power over the whole world then I do not think our mothe would want we to trade it for her life can you think of another way if this cave have some kind of magic around it I can get through that she would be ready for that there might be a way but it would all depend on you anything where be the box I do not have it with I do you think I be play game bring it to I or I kill she go ahead then go back to Rahl and explain to he how you fail he I be guess that whatever punishment you endure for let I escape go to seem like a pinprick compare to what he will do to you this time you will not let an innocent person die I be not as soft hearted as I use to be Denna not since I meet you so I will let this woman die in a heartbeat if it keep Rahl from get all three box but there be a way we can both get what we want I be listen First we put down our weapon the only bargain I will consider be the one that end with I hand the Third Box of Orden to Darken Rahl I will give you the third box after you help we steal the other two impossible you know your way in and out of the People 's Palace do not you I know the place well than he do but I be not foolish enough to try steal the box I be not ask you to but if you know the palace as well as you say then you know about the magical barrier Rahl use to protect it you believe the pristinely ungifted one can get past Rahl 's magical barrier well it be suicide but if you hand I the box I will draw a treasure map for Jennsen you draw the map Jennsen bring back the first two box then we give you the third what if Rahl suspect that I help if you do not return with the third box he be go to kill you anyway so I would say it be a risk worth take once you have all the box how do I know you will give I the third because you have Jennsen 's mother this woman be very important to you be not she Richard like you say I would rather not let an innocent person die do we have a deal shall we seal it with a kiss kill I and I can never revive she I will give she the Breath of Life if you bring I the Third Box of Orden by the time the rise sun be full in the sky you two stay here and protect the box Jennsen and I go to the palace nothing have change everything have change she have prove as if proof be need that she can not be trust you say if Darken Rahl get all three box he would have power over everyone could anyone who have the box use that magic whoever put all three box together have instant and absolute control over everybody what he command be do if I get the other two box out of the palace Richard could put they together and command Denna to give our mother this Breath of Life the magic of Orden be too dangerous it would intoxicate whoever wield it corrupt he then we go ahead with the deal we grieve for Taralyn and get Jennsen and the box as far away from here as possible Denna still need we as much as we need she she know she will not get the box if we do not get Taralyn alive you would send your sister into the belly of the beast you would leave your daughter to die yes I would Jennsen dear one for 23 year I build wall against the pain of lose your mother and now with you before I all those wall be crumble I 've only just find out I have a granddaughter I can not bear the thought of lose she too you will not lose I Grandfather the People 's Palace be surround by a tree line that act as a magical barrier only those who have be spell by Rahl 's sorcerer can pass in and out of the barrier without be instantly kill by it Richard will have to wait for you on the other side there will be alarm but you will not set they off just make sure the archer patrol the battlement do not see you they shoot on sight there be a secret entrance on the south end of the palace that lead to an escape tunnel as Lord Rahl 's personal bodyguard only the Mord Sith know of its existence you will see the opening but make sure no one be watch you because what they will see be someone walk through a solid wall follow the tunnel to the staircase at the top be an archway guard by a lone sentry he pass every 90 second wait until he go by and then run straight ahead to the entrance to Rahl 's Ceremonial Chamber Rahl trust no one so there be no living guard watch over the chamber itself it be protect only by magic the final magical shield the one close to the box allow only Rahl himself to get through of course you be the exception but be careful even if you make it past all the shield and guard Darken Rahl have an uncanny ability to sense when thing be awry Lord Rahl Mistress Denna have send word by Journey Book she will arrive by nightfall tomorrow with the Third Box of Orden tell she she will be greet with the strumming of harp and the blast of trumpet you doubt she my Lord I doubt the very sun at noon Egremont Zedd Kahlan we have the box thank the spirit I be catch in the room with Rahl I be this close to he he pick up the box he hold they he caress they imagine his surprise the next time he drop in to play with his toy look we have to get the third box to Denna it be right here welcome back Seeker you 've succeed of course I think we have a deal I 've change my mind I 've decide I want all three box now we do not have all three only two we 've hide the third tell I where it be or I will kill your love one one by one and then it will just be you and I do you think I would ever let you have the power of Orden at any price because you would rather I have the power than Rahl I would treat you kindly I would give you whatever you want or I can take away what you care about most take the Confessor first wait at least grant I the governorship of the land west of the River Drun where I can live with my friend in peace what well governor could I ask for than the Seeker then I will show you where the third box be kill they all stop drop your weapon all of you take we to our mother the sun be not up yet you say you could revive she that be before I be under your command my Lord I lie to you I know she would never last until sunrise I be sorry my Lord I fail you I be so sorry what be we go to do with her kill she slowly if that be your wish my Lord hard the way of the Seeker be not vengeance not vengeance Justice be you sure you can tell one from the other you give I the third box to stop Denna from kill we all why should it stop there do not you see what happen now I go to the People 's Palace I order Rahl to fall on my Sword I punish the guilty liberate the Midlands the war be over I 've win not this way you would become the very tyrant you would have kill Silence old man you 've all kill innocent people and now you will kill each other pick up your weapon and fight to the death anyone leave stand burn they to ash I may have only just meet you brother but I know this be not you do not touch the box Magic do not work on I not even the magic of Orden what do I do what do I do it be not you it be the power of Orden Finish I off before Darken Rahl find I enough killing please leave I to Darken Rahl be bad than kill I then I suggest you run you can not come with we Jennsen it be too dangerous now that I 've find you I wanna stay with you help you and so you shall child in your possession the Boxes of Orden can never be find by magical mean but since they should always remain separated you will take two and we will protect the third where will I keep they we have friend in the resistance who will take you in friend we would trust with our own life and when all this be over we will come and see you again and be together as a family I will escort you to our friend while Richard and Kahlan try to find out where Rahl be go next because rest assure he will not be stay in the palace may the spirit light your way through the land of shadow to the hall of eternal peace she bring we all together in the end come close close tell I what do you see the pristinely ungifted one be on their side now issue a proclamation let it be know throughout the Three Territories that until the Wizard the Seeker the Mother Confessor and all three Boxes of Orden be bring to I the people will feel my wrath one village at a time what I do that be not you Man possess the power of Orden as the power of Orden possess the man no it be I I feel that anger that hatred I still do if you do not you would be a statue not a man we all have dark desire yearning for vengeance and you must remember how those feeling stir your blood because what mark the line between good and evil be the choice not to act on they a choice you 've always make since I 've know you and I 've know you since the day you be bear can I call you Gramps not if you value your life do you remember once when I little I climb the wall of your garden and steal some apple from the big tree and you come outside and I think for sure the crazy chicken man of Blackthorn Hill would eat I for lunch you just stand there stare I be drink in the sight of my beautiful grandson you run off so quickly over the wall and down the hill so much time lose Richard so much leave unsaid never even get to talk to my mother then let I tell you about she you be the hider I will be the Seeker all right come out look what I find can I hold it maybe it be a puzzle maybe it be something magical you know why Zedd suggest we go back to Cowley Glen do not you he be hope our friend there have hear something about Darken Rahl 's movement there be a lot of place where we might get that information but only one place where the elder 's wife make Zedd 's favorite rabbit stew he ask I to get the recipe we be tramp up this mountain like pack mule to fill Zedd 's belly do you hear that I do not hear anything exactly not even bird dead all of they but how I do not know no weapon draw there be not a fight by proclamation of Lord Darken Rahl this be the fate of all those who give harbor and comfort to the Seeker 1x17 deception they murder all those people unarmed woman and child because they give I food and shelter a few month ago Darken Rahl have be kill innocent long before you get to the Midlands from the track the D'Harans who attack the settlement be not on horseback those can not be the same one tell I friend who be it I owe my life to Richard Cypher then you must be Kahlan Amnell something wrong no it be just that we 've be fight the D'Harans for so long and now to have the Seeker and Confessor stand with we it be an honor I be Garrick leader of the resistance that one be still alive command I confessor my name be Carver Dunn my unit be dispatch here from Azarith why the garrison need reinforcement the rebel in this valley have be grow strong every day I appreciate the compliment do you know what this be they call they Whisperers they have massacre four settlement in our valley we find cylinder at all of they do you know how they work a dark magic some say Rahl 's sorcerer have capture the voice of Shadow People and bottle they inside the weapon when their scream be unleash they kill everyone within a league Rahl could wipe out every village in the Midlands or terrify people into submission four attack all in this area these weapon must be somewhere nearby maybe at the fort near Grayson all the compliance mission be dispatch from there Compliance mission we will have to get into the fort and destroy these weapon the fort can not be take it be too big too many D'Haran butcher or if we could steal just one of these Whisperers we could wipe out every soldier in the garrison you will report as order get one of the weapon and bring it back to we yes confessor I will try but I be afraid I will fail you why only certain soldier be trust what kind of soldier Ones who enjoy kill then you will have to steal the weapon I will do anything to please you but I do not think I be clever enough I will be catch Carver have you ever be to this fort before I 've never be away from my post at Azarith then nobody here know you no other soldier be send from Azarith as reinforcement here I do not think so what be you get at Richard please call I Carver I will report to the fort in his place trick they into give I a Whisperer or steal it either way we use it to wipe out the entire battalion the D'Harans may be brute but they be not gullible you will not be able to bring your Sword for protection and if they even suspect that you be an imposter which be why I will have to convince they I be one of they Name and rank Archer Third Class Carver Aloysius Dunn only a confessor could get he to admit to a middle name like that keep go command officer Captain Jandor Attack position third pentangle Battle arm twenty bolt Wife 's name Marta Mary Maris one mistake and you be dead you need to study more the long we wait the more time they have to massacre more people I be ready now not quite yet Blacksmith it be time I will do it you be sure I 've have bad I be Archer Dunn my unit be attack by the rebel I be the only survivor that be a very unfortunate story Archer Dunn Dunn there you be the rebel who kill my friend I wanna make they pay assign I to a new patrol so I can go after they you already have your chance to fight but you abandon your duty you should have fight to the death I be worth more to Darken Rahl alive than I be as a corpse trust I have not you hear soldier Lord Rahl have issue new order he want to send a clear message to our enemy D'Harans always fight to the death Cowards will not be tolerate you will be execute I wanna talk to the commander shut he up he be go to want to hear this you be make a big mistake gag he I have information about the rebel if he have something to say I will hear it but it well be good what be it after

get out of this dung heap hello anyone out there we lose they except every citizen in Ixwood be go to be look for we we need to give they their treasure back before the story spread of the Seeker and the Confessor be thief except we have no idea which way the imposter go or if they even look like we if ever there be a time we need Zedd maybe he be at the tavern by now let us find out I can not believe after fight legion of D'Harans Mord Sith and Rahl himself I lose the Sword of Truth to a couple of petty criminal I mean have the Seeker ever lose the Sword before do not worry we will get it back drink for everybody I 've capture the Seeker and the Confessor you hear the gentleman Rum all around from the good bottle a word with you in private barmaid of course I know that you and your gentleman friend Gwildor have be harbor the Seeker and the Confessor Lies People will say anything in this town what I do not know be where this Gwildor be well that make two of we I have not see he in day I have instrument in my stockade very very sharp one that could have you singe quite a different song look you can carve I to bit I still will not know where he be then there be only one way you can save yourself get your hand off I I belong to another you know it be not often a man can be absolutely certain of the faithfulness of his beloved you could kill a woman give she a fright like that what have you be up to change into D'Haran Captain capture the Seeker and the Confessor or should I say two petty thief who at the moment resemble they most remarkably poor poor Frytss and Clayre this would not have anything to do with collect a rather sizeable reward now would it you brilliant woman how do you guess I 've send word to Darken Rahl Tomorrow morning a Mord Sith will take the Seeker to his dungeon little suspecting that she be pay a million piece of gold for a sorry pair of imposter after which you and I will will proceed to a certain cave in the forest where Frytss and Clayre will not alas be on hand to collect their share of the treasure leave we to bear that burden all by ourselves where be the D'Haran captain himself Retired on his pension I believe at the bottom of a well I need you to hold onto this I do not want a Mord Sith anywhere near it Wise wise thinking my love just one favor change back into the captain first I warn you he be heavily armed you know I like a well equip soldier come on sorry we be close thank the spirit you be safe Bianca can we of course have you see Zedd not yet what be go on and how do you escape we be never catch Someone 's impersonate we who and how be that even possible that be what we need to find out if people be say the Seeker and the Confessor have be capture then the D'Harans must have catch the imposter the near D'Haran be three league here we will get they out but do not you realize what a chance this be if Darken Rahl think he already have you then he will not be look for you you should get as far away from here as you can the imposter steal the treasure of Ixwood and the Sword of Truth I be so frightened for you will you at least take one precaution for I what precaution there be a D'Haran commander in here brag the Mord Sith and her escort be come down the main road take the old goat path out the front leave at the well it be slow but at least you will get there alive thank you for your help No thank you and may the spirit be with you I hate to think how many town those charlatan have raid or how many corset maybe Bianca be right we have to get the Sword of Truth back but why not let the D'Harans hand the imposter over to Rahl I mean if he think that he be capture the Seeker and Confessor he would stop look for us Rahl 's too smart to be fool by they he will realize their fraud at least they will be in his dungeon they will not be able to steal from anyone else Rahl 's not go to let they rot in his dungeon he want you alive so he could break you force you to kneel before he as an example to those that follow now he have that he could force they to say and do whatever he want make they swear their allegiance to the House of Rahl and the people of the Midlands would believe it as far as they would know we would not be fight for they they would be fight for Rahl you there Turnkey do they really expect I to eat this slop if you bring I some of those luscious juicy mutton chop I see the officer eat I could make you very glad that you do what be the problem be it those story you 've hear about Confessors and the terrible thing that they can do to a man that be all just make up to scare you no it be not that this one be yours love crumpet what I know how excited you get around leather and chain but be Darken Rahl 's torture chamber really a well alternative the prisoner have escape what where be you go as far away from here as I can get what the idiot have escape when the Mord Sith discover I 've let they get away I will be fish food give I the mirror change I back right now wait this might actually play into our hand how Darling I be come here to tell you Richard and Kahlan be on their way here now to free Frytss and Clayre you grab they when they get here then and the Mord Sith arrive I deliver the real thing but the gold in the cave Frytss and Clayre must be halfway there by now you be a D'Haran captain send a quad after they with order to kill

Promise you will let we go on our way and the Seeker here will be more than happy to finish what I be so rude to interrupt what show no mercy thank all the spirit in creation I find you in time yes

Sith and how do this amulet work if I can get somebody to look into it their reflection stay inside and if I get you to look into it I can turn you into they Montressor 's Mirror create by a sorcerer who want to capture the image of his beloved die wife and then have she with he always it be be lose for century well Gwildor find it he win it at card this be Gwildor 's fault he pull we into this I only go along with it because pork brain here swear that we be go to be aid the true Seeker in his quest Gwildor 's her friend not mine and for a few tot of rum she could be your friend too how do this Gwildor manage to capture the real Richard and Kahlan 's reflection when they come through a few week ago Gwildor 's lady friend trick they into look into the mirror she just give they a shave and a bath she be a tavern keeper her name 's Bianca and we think she be a friend if she be not your friend anymore that mean she be your enemy and see as she be our enemy too that make we all friend

wonderful do not even try Bianca do you think you could fool a Wizard of the First Order I want the magic mirror so when I find the imposter you create I can change they back to their sorry self before they heap even more infamy on the Seeker 's good name if you give I the tiny clue as to what you be talk about perhaps I can help you would a touch of the Confessor 's hand be clue enough how do I know she be not an imposter how do you know there be only one way to find out be you willing to risk it I would love to have you as my willing slave Bianca all the thing I would have you do for I no take it take it and may it bring you less trouble than it be bring I where 's Gwildor he be at the D'Haran camp posing as a captain of the guard where be Richard and Kahlan you mean they be not you be look well for someone who just stab a knife in the back of every friend she have where be the real Seeker and Confessor they 've probably fall into the trap that Gwildor set for they the Mord Sith may already have come to take they to Darken Rahl please let I go that be all I know that be all the help I can give you I feel certain you have much much more to give the gold Lord Rahl insist upon delivery of the captive to the People 's Palace before the reward be pay he be be disappoint too many time if you want the gold you will have to come with we it will be my honor to personally present the captive to Lord Rahl his gratitude would be even great if you deliver the Wizard as well and where might the Wizard be Seeker wait you have be fool mistress these be the real Seeker and Confessor the one ye get there be imposter and so be he he be nothing but a common thief disguise himself with magic and I can prove it how could you betray I now to unmask his accomplice I do not know who you

enough for you have your head crush between stone while rat gnaw your foot to the ankle be barely good enough for you what do I do to deserve such a good fortune he be set a trap for you of course he be some feeble attempt to rescue his friend which be why I be go to walk into the trap alone the one person in the world a Wizard can not use his power against be a Mord Sith in a manner of speak what about I Run Gwildor catch they I be sorry mistress there be so many of they and I can not run but at least you have the Wizard Cold comfort when the prize be the Seeker but well than no comfort at all

quickly as we could Wizard Zorander Confessor it be an honor this be Flynne Captain of the Guard forgive the rude welcome our nerve be a little fray lately would that have anything to do with why you ask we to come it be good if you hear that from the king himself thank you for come so quickly it pain I to delay you on your mission to defeat Darken Rahl help those who stand against Rahl be part of that mission my kingdom be be terrorize by a vicious beast that be ravage our countryside and I need your help to destroy this monster tell I where to find this beast you already have it be I five month ago the D'Harans begin amass troop along this border from there Rahl 's soldier launch raid on our farmland burn our crop with our food stock dwindle Rahl know we could not repel a siege an invasion be imminent I have no choice but to seek an alliance with our neighbor here in Agaden Reach the domain of that she devil Shota forgive I but why would you seek an alliance with someone as dangerous as Shota the witch woman have the ability to see the future I be hope she would help we change it I remind Shota our kingdom be all that separate she from Rahl 's tighten grip that if Caddock be overrun Agaden Reach would soon follow so I strike a bargain with her in exchange for my pledge to defend she she promise to give I the power to protect my kingdom forever and how exactly do she do that she curse I each night I would be transform into a Calthrop an awful beast that haunt the nightmare of all D'Harans the Calthrop be one of the few thing D'Haran child be teach to fear for century they 've frighten each other around campfire with tale of the creature 's blood lust for week I venture close to the D'Haran camp at nightfall I would become the creature the few who survive the slaughter flee back to D'Hara spread story of the brutal Calthrop that stalk the forest around Caddock soon Rahl 's force be too terrified to cross into our kingdom with morale suffering and his troop stretch thin Rahl abandon his attempt to conquer we once the D'Haran troop pull away from our border I go back to Shota and I ask she to remove the curse I could not risk butcher my own people but she refuse and once the Calthrop 's hunger could not be quench I have my most loyal man all swear to secrecy chain I in the wood but the beast break through the chain and kill they all I spend half my treasury on purchase this a rada'han I would hope its ability to suppress magic would be enough to overcome Shota 's curse I lock the rada'han around my brother 's neck yet he still transform and somehow manage to escape from it I be too ashamed to have my people know that their king be the Calthrop so now each night I head to the most remote part of the forest a place call Knollwood Grove anyone venture into the wood after dark rarely make it out alive I have no memory of these attack but each morning I awake with the taste of blood on my tongue three day ago I awake to find the savaged remain of my late victim the face stare back at I be that of my own wife I have murder my beloved queen it be not your fault brother you be only try to protect your kingdom and now the kingdom must be protect from I I 've try to end my life Poison hang a dagger to my heart but you can not be kill because Shota give you exactly what you ask for the power to protect your kingdom forever what make you think I can help you accord to legend the only thing that can kill a Calthrop be the Sword of Truth can not you lift the curse only the one who make it can break it I will go to Agaden Reach and try to reason with Shota be you sure few who have go there have ever return I know I be one of those few and if you fail what then I can not bear the thought of kill another innocent person while Zedd be go I will watch over you and keep you from harm anyone how the monster can break through our strong chain I may have a few trick that your blacksmith do not when the evening bell chime I will come find you Seeker your Highness I be come with you forgive I but I 've already harm too many people I could not bear to add the Mother Confessor to that toll Father this be Princess Corah my daughter we be honor to have you here our people have live in fear for so long we be very sorry to hear about your mother princess just promise I you will find the horrible beast that murder my mother and you will kill it you be sure these chain will hold Zedd 's magic have make they unbreakable I hope you be right Seeker but swear to I if it be a question of my life or yours you will kill I I swear we will make sure it do not come to that as much as I enjoy your company you can not watch over I every night I just have to do it until Zedd can convince Shota to lift the curse I 've be expect you Zeddicus then you know why I 've come I can not imagine it be to apologize for scorn I all those year ago I be once a foolish young Wizard I never mean to hurt you and yet you leave without a word of explanation those word may have be my last I show you our future together with our combine power we could have move mountain our child would have rule for a thousand generation and now look at you Zeddicus reduce to crawl back beg I for a favor why should I do anything for you not for I for King Gregor with whom you share a common enemy he be beat back the D'Harans and insure the safety of his land and yours the king kill his own people do not benefit you at all release he from the curse Put an end to this pointless bloodshed without the Calthrop this be what will come to pass the D'Harans will launch their army they will seize the castle Caddock will fall and my realm will be next what I bestow on King Gregor it be not a curse it be a blessing I meet your mother once you do she visit Aydindril when I be a young confessor she be very kind to I I can see the resemblance I still can not believe she be go I lose my mother when I be very young I know how painful it can be it would be easy if I know why she leave the castle what she be do out there the night she die what be it Duncan where 's Helena we take a wagon to fetch her family as you ask when we pass through Knollwood Grove our horse be bit by a snake vine I run back here as fast as I could to get another horse they be still at Knollwood Grove that be one of the beast 's hunting ground it be almost sundown no one be allow to leave the castle but there be child out there just tell I where to find they I will bring they back I be go with you no it be too dangerous I be the one who put they in danger with the Calthrop loose my lady in wait got worry I send she to go get they put yourself in danger will not help no it will help you we can move fast if I show you the way it be start please Seeker do not let I hurt anyone else stay back I do not want to hurt you as soon as we get this hitch we can get out of here Mother I be scared it be all right little one we will be on our way soon fight I Run run take the child Run kill it be you all right Kahlan stop Kahlan it be I Richard stop it be okay I be so sorry be you all right I think so now that that beast be dead Father the Calthrop be not the only monster out there last night that be the second time I 've go into the Con Dar and I still do not have control over it the first time I almost destroy you and last night I almost destroy Corah but you do not only because you stop I once it get a hold of I it be like I be some wild animal I do not know what I be do you be try to protect I from the Calthrop if my mother be alive she could teach I to control it but on my own it be only a matter of time before I hurt someone someone I care about we kill the Calthrop yes I hear and that be the problem Shota show I a vision of what would happen to this kingdom without the Calthrop I see a D'Haran invasion soldier storm the castle and one of their commander take the king 's throne well we know Shota 's vision can be avert but I be afraid in order to do that we may need Shota to curse someone else the D'Harans will prepare their invasion once they learn the Calthrop have be slay as much as the people fear and hate the beast it keep they safe from Rahl then we have to make sure the D'Harans do not find out if we can keep the legend of the Calthrop alive we can keep the D'Harans from invade and spare anyone else the burden of carry Shota 's curse maybe but how long could we keep up such a ruse long enough for I to defeat Rahl why do not my father tell I he be try to protect you if my father do not think I be strong enough to hear the truth how can I lead this kingdom I know you can but maybe I should not maybe I should ask Marius to assume the throne in my place if you decide it be too much no one would fault you but if I be not mistaken your mother be not much old than you when she take the throne but she have my father and you have both of they inside you I 've see your strength you make the decision to ride out to save Helena and her child even though you know the danger I do not think your people could ask for a more courageous leader as Queen I pledge my fealty to this great kingdom to defend its people from all enemy and lead it into peace and prosperity spirit bless our kingdom spirit bless our queen the only way the D'Harans will believe the Calthrop be still alive be if there be be another attack my Queen Captain Flynne and I will slaughter sheep and leave the carcass at the border we will spread word along trade route the D'Harans will believe it be the work of the Calthrop I may have something that will help those effort I can place several of these chime in the forest that border D'Hara and cast a spell on they the slight disturbance in the air say from an approach D'Haran and the chime will ring out only it will not be just any chime they will hear it will be the awful howl of the Calthrop the ear be more easily frightened than the eye we will make preparation at once your Majesty I want to thank you I do not know what I would 've do if you have not be here if there be anything I can do for you there be one favor you could grant I your Majesty why be you wear that because I can not trust myself I be use to have control be a confessor be about certainty about know the truth when I be in the Con Dar I do not have any of that the rada'han give a little of it back to I but we do not even know if it work it do not stop King Gregor it work I can feel it suppress my power already maybe it be something that should not suppress you say only the most powerful Confessors have it right then maybe this be a gift one you should not deny it be a part of who you be when I be in the Con Dar I do not know who that be More news from our spy in the castle not only be King Gregor dead but so be the Calthrop then the kingdom of Caddock be ripe for the taking but we must act quickly if we want the Seeker as well accord to our spy he will not remain at caddock much long he would leave the kingdom defenseless the child queen want we to believe that the Calthrop still live they plan to deceive we to deceive we and how do they intend to do that if Kahlan could learn to use the Con Dar just think of how powerful we could be there be some thing that even a Wizard of the First Order do not fully understand this be one thing I I can not teach Kahlan maybe we should respect her decision to wear the rada'han a power be only valuable if it can be harness if not then it be no power at all that sound just like a Calthrop I have not cast the spell yet another monster Zedd 's on his way to find out who Shota curse what do we do when we find this person we prevent they from hurt innocent people shall I inform Prince Marius be there something else bother you I be go through my mother 's thing and find her diary I know why she be outside the castle the night she die she believe my father be unfaithful and that at night he would meet a woman who the diary do not say only that the woman live near Knollwood Grove my mother go there to confront they but the king could not have be unfaithful by night he be the Calthrop but my mother do not know that my father keep it a secret even from her why would she think he be unfaithful because someone tell she the diary do not say who only that it be someone she trust whoever tell she know where the king would be at night and send she to her death there be only one person besides your father who know the truth about the Calthrop Prince Marius think about it Marius stand the most to gain an entire kingdom maybe he orchestrate the queen 's death at the hand of the Calthrop and he know the king would be so grief stricken over kill his wife he would wanna die so the prince summon the Seeker to fulfill his wish and if it be the kingdom that Marius want then only one person stand in his way I no sign of Prince Marius my man have search he be not here when be the last time anyone see he when I inform he of the Calthrop he can not have get far I will find he keep the queen safe this way your Majesty what be the safe place in the castle I be afraid there be no place safe for you you be part of Marius ' plot take they she wear a rada'han her magic can not harm you where be you off to in such a hurry where be you last night the sun 's go down soon maybe you come out here to transform into the Calthrop you think I be the monster I know you be a monster you arrange the death of the queen and your brother why would I do such a thing because you think he be too weak to protect the kingdom I love my brother but you love his power more and you would do anything to get it and hold onto it even if it mean strike a deal with Shota to make you the Calthrop you 've go mad we will find out soon enough who be it Shota who have you curse now you still do not understand do you Zeddicus I do not curse anyone enough game I promise King Gregor that his kingdom would be protect forever so I curse the royal scepter whoever inherit the kingdom inherit the curse it will not take they long to break down this door I will have to confess one of the guard but I will need your help to take off the rada'han wait we need to get everyone out of the castle Take'em to the cave until you get word it be safe to return right away what be happen Corah be the Calthrop she be loose inside the castle we have to stop the beast without hurt Corah maybe we could use the rada'han to change the queen back it do not work on the king and why be that I have no idea what you be you be in charge of lock King Gregor into the rada'han each night I lace his meal with a sleep potion once he be asleep I unlock the rada'han unleash the Calthrop so all we have to do be get this thing around the beast 's neck I think Marius can help with that how may I serve you you be go to be the bait it be all right I be here I do not understand if I be the monster why do Marius sneak out of the castle before sunset I be on my way to warn the D'Haran that the Calthrop be still alive you murder my mother and father all so you could kneel before Rahl in exchange for swear my allegiance to Darken Rahl the D'Harans agree to leave I on the throne but you be not able to deliver your message to the D'Harans so they think the Calthrop be dead they be plan to invade Caddock they will be here soon let they come I will remove the rada'han the Calthrop will slaughter every last one it be too late it be over Seeker there be no escape bring the Seeker to I you will not kill I Rahl want I alive true but he do not say in how many piece you will find it difficult to escape without your hand Fools see what you 've do this will come to pass within the hour we can not do anything you be right when you say together we have the power to move mountain Shota in fact I think we could move something far great bring the Seeker to I you will not kill I Rahl want I alive true but he do not say in how many piece you will find it difficult to escape without your hand what witchery be this do not you see Zeddicus together we can accomplish anything nothing can stop we that be precisely the reason why I leave you all those year ago ultimate power must not go unchecked you know this as well as I do Shota we would become monster that be the very reason we must defeat Darken Rahl then there be something else I must show you the D'Harans will not stop run until they reach the People 's Palace and once the story spread of the Calthrop terrorize the kingdom they will think twice about invade again what happen when my people learn the truth about the Calthrop maybe they do not need to know you can wear the rada'han at night to suppress the curse but do not you need it my power be part of who I be I try to deny it and it only put people in danger I need to embrace it learn to control it I think I have to do the same my father be too ashamed to tell his people the truth about himself and look what it cost he if he have tell my mother he be the Calthrop she never would have leave the castle that night and they would both be alive nothing good can come from hide who I be what be wrong when the D'Harans have you I try to bring on the Con Dar but I could not even when I need it most it take your whole life to learn how to use your confessor power give it time we have to hurry what be it Shota show I a vision there be another Book of Counted Shadows long ago in secret an ancient monk transcribe a copy of the book if we could get our hand on it we could defeat Rahl do Shota 's vision show you where it be but there be more to her vision soon Rahl will also learn of the Book 's whereabouts and when he do he will send man to retrieve it the only question be can we get there

need a book from the library but I could not take she and Aidan out of the painting they would be in danger from those man so instead of bring Livia to the library you bring the library to Livia not just the library but everything in it all the people the book Amazing be not it Zedd be in the library with a D'Haran patrol D'Harans Zedd 's a Wizard he should be able to handle a few D'Harans no you do not understand a Wizard 's power be useless inside my painting the only magic that work in there be mine my man tell I you appear out of nowhere what magic do you use to hide from we answer I who be you be not it obvious she be an innocent woman who be bring her son to the library to read book something I seriously doubt you be familiar with how do you get past my soldier outside D'Haran scum you kill my father Adian no do not hurt he tell I who you be or I will reunite your son with his depart father I I work here I be the librarian you need to use your magic and get they out of there I will of course confessor but I can not not from here you see this easel to get someone out I need to paint they on that canvas but I can only do that from inside the painting it be how I design it you can not go in there the D'Harans could take you prisoner or kill you what other choice do we have send I into the painting Richard I will take care of the D'Harans and help Livia find the book yes and I can follow you in and paint everyone out where be the Book of Counted Shadows I do not know exactly you be go to find it for I because if you do not hurt the boy will not get you what you want any fast I will do anything you say just do not hurt my son please do you have any idea how stupid you be Aidan Finding that book will not do you any good because even if you do you can not give it to Darken Rahl do you even know where you be have you look outside you be not in the Midlands anymore it be say that you be the deadly of the deadly my elite guardian and how be it possible for an entire library to be spirit away in front of you do you see nothing at all well since your eye be obviously useless allow I to do you the favor of cut they from your skull my Lord one of our soldier survive an attack less than a league from here he say his man be set upon by a Wizard and a Confessor I should have know this be Wizard 's work and if Zeddicus and the Mother Confessor be nearby the Seeker can not be far send every last one of these soldier into Briamont and the surround area turn over every stone search every building and bring I the Seeker yes my Lord a Wizard must have conjure this illusion you appear out of nowhere you must know something about this I I do not have any magic if I do would I have let your man capture I so easily but if there be magic at work here if this entire building have be send to some mysterious realm then there be no tell what other danger lurk here if I be you I would get out of this place as fast as I could keep he quiet take a quad scout the area find out who be responsible for this sorcery how long be this go to take something funny you look very heroic a world without magic sound perfect without magic you would be deprive of your power to Confess the Sword of Truth would be merely a piece of steel Magic have its use but sometimes it keep people apart be you ready Seeker it be the Seeker drop your weapon you be stall I 've be try to decipher this clue for week I do not think you be properly motivate please let he go drop the sword or she die if she die Rahl will not get his precious book he will kill you himself not nearly as effective as Wizard 's fire but sometimes one be force to improvise James be go to get we all out of here but first we 've get to find the Book I be not lie to that D'Haran I do not know if I can solve the final clue maybe Richard and I can help this merchant claim to have information on the Seeker be that so yes Lord Rahl the Seeker threaten I he be look for someone a child uh for what reason I do not know but I tell he where the boy be last see and where be that surely news of such import would be worthy of a small reward of some kind tell Lord Rahl where you see the Seeker no no please general I do understand a man should be justly reward for information as valuable as this tell I where you send the Seeker and rest assure you will never want for anything in this life again oh you you be very generous my Lord Third block south of Barter Street Second door east side thank you you have be most helpful I 've be try to translate but the language must be old I 've never come across it before Richard have it be the language of the Book of Counted Shadows an ancient script that only the Seeker can read what do it say the book you seek be hide in a safe place between the world below and the star above that could be anywhere no it be here in the library this be our astrological collection the star above and these be about the keeper and the underworld the world below the truth of the word of the Book of Counted Shadows can only be insure by a Confessor my husband spend year search for this book all the time it be right here what we value most be often close than we think what be you still do here ha art can not be rush D'Haran soldier be search the town it will not be long before they come here we can not let Rahl 's man get ahold of the painting once James be inside we will smuggle it out of what have you do you hear what she say the D'Harans be on their way she will be safe in there you be go to get everyone out I be go in next after I be go get the painting out of here bury it in the forest someplace no one will ever find it that be not the plan if you want to save the Seeker and the other you will do as I say Kahlan what be you do here I do not know Livia thank the prophet you be all right what be go on why be Kahlan here I I send she here to protect she we get what we come for it be time to go go why would anyone want to leave this place look at this world I 've create it be a paradise all of we will be safe here we will be happy forever where might you be off to in such a hurry James if you want to stay in this place that be your choice but we have a mission to complete your mission it be to defeat Darken Rahl but but what if Rahl defeat you he will get his hand on that book and enslave all the world everyone be well off if the Book stay here where Rahl can never get it sentimental tripe tell I do you create these allege work of art no Lord Rahl the Amulet of Carod you must be an ally of the Wizard no doubt you 've see he recently and what be this I be order you as a confessor to get we out of here you do not have any power here no magic we be all equal here curious everything I 've be search for in this wretched little town be depict right here the Seeker the Mother Confessor and the library if I be the sort of person who believe in myth and fairy tale I might suspect that this be an enchanted painting it be as you say my Lord it be sentimental tripe it be worthless well then you will not mind if I do we all a favor of destroy it my Lord do not if you burn that paint you destroy the Book of Counted Shadows you 've be a good friend ever since my husband die and I be grateful but we can not stay here why would you want to go back there be D'Harans out there maybe the same one that kill your husband everything you love be in this place your son your book and what about the Seeker and his friend you can not keep they here Aidan need people around he who will be a good influence without a father he need someone to teach he right from wrong can you imagine a well teacher for he than the Seeker you be right the boy need guidance and maybe I could give it to he but not here the two of you I I hear what you say in my workshop I see how you look at each other both of you want to come here not as your prisoner but in the real world magic be your prison it be what keep people apart those be your word out there your love would destroy he but here you can be together if the Book of Counted Shadows be in this painting then you 've win have I the Seeker could be learn the Book 's secret even as we speak but if he be imprison in there he can never again be a threat to you enough what what be you go to do run I through if you kill I you will still be here in time all of you will learn to accept it this really be a well place for all of we may I suggest we take the painting to your sorcerer in time they may find a way to extract the Book perhaps but at of the Seeker if his magic be the only kind that work here we need to find a way to recreate it James learn this magic by read in the library if we could find the book we might be able to do the same James say it could only be master by a painter like he so without talent it might not work at all we have to try I could use some help find those book this do not make sense what do he hope to accomplish by keep we here I do not think it be ever about we Jas I know you think that keep we here be go to get you what you want but it be not go to work all I want be to keep everyone safe I do not need any magic to know that it be more than that you may have notice how Richard and I look at each other but I see how you look at Livia I 've admire she for so long after her husband die I I think I would I would have a chance but she never pay attention to I that be why I be so glad that you be here confessor know about these thing you you can explain to Livia convince she that I be a good person I know how difficult it can be share your feeling with the one you love what if she do not feel the same way you do of course she do not feel the same way she barely know I so you think if she be force to spend some time with you she would get to know you see who you really be and fall in love with you why could not she love I I may not be a hero like the Seeker or some great scholar like her husband but I be an artist I 've get so much to give I can protect she be a father to her son you have to give Livia a chance to know you outside this world as beautiful as it be it be not real since the Seeker 's return he have bring I nothing but misery and despair Time and again he have deny I victory no Egremont it end here what of the Book and its secret kill the Seeker be more important than any book no matter what secret it may hold you can not what be happen my beautiful painting Someone be try to destroy it why would someone do this they be destroy paradise you can always make another painting but you can not give people their life back you say you want to protect Livia if you love she you can not let she die James I can not paint six people before the fire get here but you can paint the library back to where it belong along with everyone inside get your easel let us go you would well hurry what about you there be not time Richard what we have to go get to the library fast I believe congratulation be in order my Lord send the man to the library now follow I he do it James save we we should get move the D'Harans will be head this way I 've mask our trail they be not follow we you can not stay in Briamont it be not safe for anyone who be help the Seeker where will we go Bishop 's landing be two day ' walk the resistance will help you resettle I can take you Mom you can not leave what about Dad 's work your book I find the one that matter and as long as I have you I will be all right I think you will be need this I can not thank you enough you may have help bring this war to an end in his heart James be a good person please try to make sure his sacrifice be not for nothing do not worry it be only I a little light reading not how I would describe it something on your mind I be just think about James the world he create it would have be nice to visit now and then I know what you mean I will let you get back to your book this can not be right what be it it say there be only one way I can defeat Rahl to vanquish the master of all the Seeker must wield the power of Orden Orden to do that we would have to get the box back reassemble they the last time we do that I almost become as evil as Rahl himself subtitle by LeapinLar I think you like my stew I do not like beet that be why I put all your in your father 's bowl now go wash your hand Jennsen you have to run the D'Harans be here they be raid people ' home look for you and the Boxes of Orden how do hurry they be on their way take this it be an Alkalis Stone crack it between your tooth to release the poison it will be over in ten heartbeat you want I to kill myself it be a well fate than what the D'Harans will do to you if they catch you now run Quick out the back now go open the door be she go to be all right where be she please leave my family alone we have not do anything find she Mm Commander track sir she could not have get far this way where be the box I do not have any box like wind over a field of grass all blade bend to Orden for the one who wield the magic bend the will of all to the will of one do not mean to frighten you my boy you 've be at it all night perhaps you should get some sleep accord to this the only way to defeat Rahl be to put all three Boxes of Orden together at the next full moon but the last time I put the box together the power turn I into a monster if Jennsen have not separate the box I would probably have raze every village in D'Hara by now the power of Orden possess you now you must learn to possess the power of Orden how keep read Orden be a voracious wolf its strength rival only by its insatiable appetite only one power can touch the beast 's heart and tame it what kind of magic could tame the power of Orden somehow make it safe to use I 've never hear of a magic strong than the power of Orden you once say of all the magic in the world there be none more powerful than love that be an old expression as old as the Book of Counted Shadows what be you think that the one force that can touch the beast 's heart and tame it be love the touch of love Confession I have to be confess of course a Confessor 's touch could temper the power of Orden so you would not turn into a tyrant and likewise Orden would temper the power of love so you would not become a mindless slave you would be leave with the ability to command Darken Rahl we would well tell Kahlan no Zedd wait wait for as long as I 've know she the one thing she be be most afraid of be hurt I we only have one of the box until we get the other two from Jennsen there be no point in tell Kahlan let she sleep here we be for my sister hello hm hello Jennsen Sean it be I Richard what what be you do no Kahlan do not he be a friend at least he use to be I be sorry I never think I could hurt the Seeker Sean tell we what be go on Darken Rahl find out we be hide Jennsen to punish we he unleash a magical plague on our village Marilee die yesterday and now my little girl be sick Rahl will only give we the cure in exchange for the Seeker 's head where be Jennsen the D'Harans come she escape into the wood with the box just before they kick in my door we have to find she there be something else you should know I give she an Alkalis Stone in case she be capture I do not know if she be dead or alive but we be in terrible trouble People be suffer like I have never see the healthy banish all of the sick here they be afraid every day more be herd into the encampment what be this scourge we do not know People have start call it the Fire Fever because it spread like wildfire careful not to touch anyone if you do the fire will leap from their blood into yours the hot blood create these welt once the welt appear the person do not have much time you have no idea what it be like to see your child suffer and not be able to comfort she even with a simple touch be there anything you can do for her yes there be and a few other but it will require I to draw the illness out of their body and take it into my own I will need time to rest and purge the illness from my own blood every time I heal someone if I take on too much or do not have enough time to heal myself I will fall to the plague the same as everyone else but I will do what I can we have to find Jennsen and get the box if I can put they all together I can force Rahl to give we the cure Richard we do not even know if Jennsen 's still alive it be a wonder she be not dead the bad be over alert I the moment she wake this girl steal the box from my palace and be the only one who know where they be so unless she tell I where she be hide they the bad be not yet over for her my Lord she be awake but there be a problem she do not seem to remember anything how convenient my Lord if I may I believe she be tell the truth your man be overzealous with her they beat she viciously I 've see people who have suffer blow like this to the head and often their sense be dull it be not surprising she be lose her memory who be you you do not remember I no I do not even know where I be or how I get here it be all right you be safe now I be a friend and this be my home should I know you I be sorry no please do not apologize it be not your fault and I promise I will tell you everything but perhaps it be a blessing that you do not remember the terrible thing your brother do to you my brother People call he the Seeker if you have manage to chop my head off where would you have take it there be a D'Haran garrison only a day 's journey away if I confess whoever be in charge of this garrison we might find out what happen to Jennsen and the box we might even be able to get the cure what do you mean if Rahl create this plague then maybe he have a way to protect his own man from it I will stay here and do what I can to help while you two go to the garrison how be we go to get close enough to confess he they want the Seeker 's head Let us give it to they I have the head of the Seeker I will give it only to the commander tell he to bring the cure for the fever to Sorcerer 's Bluff alone and I will exchange the head for the cure my son be next and then their love one I be sorry but I need to rest now I can only cure a few at a time or the sickness will overtake I and and I will not be able to cure anyone once you 've rest you will heal my son the village baker be next you will heal the baker over my die child the baker will bake the bread necessary to feed everyone and give they strength I be sorry but these be the difficult decision I must make and who be you to decide who live and who die the Almighty Creator I be Zeddicus zu'l Zorander Wizard of the First Order and you will wait your turn and then your brother put all three box together and he use the power to make the Mother Confessor beat a poor defenseless unarmed woman kill she slowly do you remember any of this a little do we have to keep talk about this it be all so ugly I understand you need to rest I promise we will not go on much long but you need to know the truth there be few survivor my man who do come back tell I the Seeker force they to collect their weapon and fight each other to the death it must have be so horrible all that death and all of they Fathers son brother but you you be pristinely ungifted Magic do not affect you you be the one person the Seeker could not control and you see your brother for the monster that he be and you bravely pull the box apart do not touch the box Magic do not work on I not even the magic of Orden no and once you pull they apart you run away with two but you must have hide they somewhere but then the Seeker come after you and unfortunately he find you before I do where be the box I do not have any box it be not the Seeker who hit I he have many follower he must 've send man after you I can not believe my own brother would do that do you remember where you hide the box please stop I do not wanna think about it anymore there there Shh it be all right you be safe now Shh I promise the Seeker will never hurt you again Shh Kahlan no what be wrong his neck he have the Fire Fever if you touch he you will die one of my man find he abandon I think he could use a friend oh he be adorable thank you oh Baby it be okay I wonder if any of your memory have return they be all so horrible maybe it be well not to remember hey I understand what be they do with that D'Haran scum what be go on here stay back I suggest you show the Mother Confessor some courtesy be you all right Zedd a bit of rest would do I well what have we here it seem Rahl neglect to protect his own man when he send they to spread the sickness the commander here have the Fire Fever if we deliver the Seeker 's head to Lord Rahl we can all be cure can you heal he so Kahlan can confess he he be the one who infect we how dare you heal that butcher before my son this man might have important information we need he to tell we what happen to Jennsen the Seeker 's sister what make she more important than we if we find she we might be able to get the cure from Rahl but we 've be wait you say my boy be next I be sorry but circumstance have change you will have to wait a while long be you all right Richard Cypher and his confessor ambush one of my garrison I 've just have to tell another mother that her son have die at the hand of the Seeker I be sorry I can not believe my own brother could be so cruel I know exactly how you feel he be my brother too I do not know how to tell you this Jennsen but you Richard and I share the same father his name be Panis Rahl there be a time when peace and freedom prosper in D'Hara but our father conquer one kingdom after the other swallow they all up for himself he be a cruel and bloodthirsty tyrant he do unspeakable thing to the people and even his own family I 've never tell this to anyone before our father once boast to I when I be barely as tall as his sword that he have be give a prophecy one day he would sire a bastard son who would rise to be the Seeker and that Seeker would kill I and even after he have learn of this prophecy he still continue to take countless woman my mother from what I know of your mother she be good and she be kind she keep you safe from our father I be not so lucky when I be old and strong I stand up to our father and I kill he I reach out to Richard hope that a brotherly love could avert the prophecy but only then do I realize that he have inherit our father 's cruelty but like so many villain he believe he be a hero but if he get hold of those box he will do terrible thing to this world far bad than our father be ever capable of we have to stop he how if I could remember where I hide the box you could get to they first safe to confess he now command I confessor you be order to capture a young girl Jennsen where be she I do not know we capture she but Rahl 's general take she away why one of my man beat she because she would not tell we where the box be I believe General Egremont think Rahl could get the information out of her stay here and help Zedd you be take I to where my sister be capture now you must have hide the box somewhere safe but you have to flee someone must 've tell you the Seeker be come after you Jennsen you have to run the farmer who be hide I tell I to run yes you have to run but you would not have leave the box behind

but someone knock I to the ground and I lose it this be the exact spot where she be capture it must have be one of the Seeker 's man but try to remember what happen before you be knock down what do you do with the box she come through here but she do not have the box when she be catch so she must have hide they somewhere between here and the cottage where be they Jennsen what do you do with they

Seeker have be hunt I for month his man almost kill I how could I go back to he now maybe if you go to he and you tell he what he want to hear that he be a great hero and he be right about I you tell he that I capture you and I torture you but you would not tell I where the box be tell he that you steal the cure from I and you finally escape and then you run back to he but I take the box from he from everything you 've tell I it do not sound like he would forgive I for that Jennsen I know our brother as long as you pretend to be on his side and not mine he will not hurt you all you need to remember be that he simply want to be love tell he whatever lie about I you have to you tell he that I know he have the box and I be come for they and I will place a magical tracer cloud on they to make it more convincing then when you have his trust and he turn his back on you you bring the box back to I I know what you be think what if I be not tell the truth you 've lose your memory how would you know if I be lie or not how can you be sure of anything what if this be just some sort of ploy Jennsen if I be the cruel tyrant that Richard paint I as why would I want to save people I do not know I would give anything not to have to ask this of you but my people be die so if you take my fast horse and ride through the night you can make it to where the people be suffer and when you give the cure to the ailing and you see that it work you will know which brother truly care for the people and you will know which brother to side with I have the box my mistress be die she confess a sick man to save I how long until you recover I be already weaken before the mob overcome I the Fire Fever have I now Richard I be not go to recover Zedd I be not go to let either of you die I be go to

we no you two will have to go on without I I be go to find Rahl then I will swallow the Alkalis Stone just before I put the box together and with the power of Orden I will command Rahl to send the cure back to the valley and then I will kill he and before I can turn into a tyrant the Alkalis Stone will kill I Richard th there must be another way it be the only way he will be dead and I will be dead and everyone else will live dear boy the prophecy say the Seeker will defeat Rahl it do not say he will live to be a wise old man like his grandfather thank you so much you be welcome Jennsen I

Cara how do a sea hawk find a tiny fish in the great wide ocean be you ready to risk destroy his soul why would not I be ready for that I understand your fear child but the Seeker have find the meaning within the Book of Counted Shadows and the Book tell he that the dark power of Orden can be temper only by the Confessor 's touch the Seeker would be enslave neither by love nor by evil will finally be able to fulfill the Prophecy and kill Darken Rahl what if what if we be wrong what if this be some sort of trick you 've always put your faith in the Seer even before you know his smile or the sound of his voice and that faith have be reward time and again now be not the time to waiver FOOTSTEPS APPROACH it be go to be all right bird squawk no SCREAMS RICHARD screaming thunder rumble

another way just tell he Alice tell he that his own Confessor never stop love he and that if he can not undo the magic if he can not return to she then she will be wait for he in the underworld forever we be waste heat what do you mean try not to be an idiot have it occur to you that with all his confessed follower we we may not be able to get close enough to the Master to kill he do not worry Seeker I promise not to tell your legion of admirer that you admit to a doubt SIGHS what then we would be alone just the two of we I do not know about you but I would need to find some small bit

CHUCKLES that be exactly what she say to I what do you tell she it be perfectly simple all you have to do be combine the magic of Orden Confessor and Agiel precisely the right way precisely the right time but even if you have the box even if this harlot 's willing to help you you be still miss one essential ingredient the touch of a Confessor that be why she agree to marry Rahl so she could bear a child that would help you instead she give birth to an abomination maybe her child will help we after all a trick no the truth you speak in riddle Seeker it be simple you be go to let the Master Confess you do you know where we can find he the Master will be very unhappy if you kill the only person in the world that know how he can get his hand on the power of Orden take I to he Master be you here command I confessor tell I why you be here the Seeker have return he have all three box of Orden he want you to confess he why would he want that because you do it at the very moment he put the box together and then he be strike with a Mord Sith 's Agiel he will return to a time before you be bear and kill your father and then you Master will never be I destroy the Mord Sith one of they have travel with he from the past they plot your demise then I will kill they you will not be able to the Seeker will be wait with the box at the Crags of blood under the full moon and he be the Seeker the moment he sense the slight threat he will put the box together and if you do not confess he he will have the power of Orden and he will rule even you but you know how I can defeat he if you confess he but prevent the Mord Sith from add her magic to his then you will control the man who control Orden your power will be absolute and eternal SIGHS you say we would only be fight on the same side until the Master 's dead and if this work he will be wipe from history he will never be bear but if you go back to fighting on the side of his father this could all happen all over again you 've see the legacy of Rahl you 've see what can happen if he win ask yourself be this really a future worth fight for I 've be expect you Master Rahl I be an old friend of your mother 's find the Mord Sith grunt

start I can not believe I would marry Rahl bear his child Kahlan now that I be back that future do not happen or never will happen still Kahlan when we first meet you tell I you would give your life for the Seeker that be what you do even when it look like you have no hope you love I across time the magic of Orden be no more Rahl be dead the Prophecy have be fulfil so it be over the magic bond that bend Rahl 's follower to his will be break now it be possible that we be at the dawn of a new age an age of peace harmony justice it be also possible that with the demise of Rahl new and unimagined evil will arise to fill the void seize the broken shard of power Richard you 've do everything we 've ask of you and more no one can blame you if you want to go home CHUCKLES I be home

go down and offend our host kingdom fall the Seeker then shall the tyrant 's only be dead a week savor each victory Richard as though it be a juicy leg of mutton you never know when it will be your

you bastard we be waste time Cara you be disturb my bath Triana while you be wash your hair D'Hara be go to piece we should go to the People 's Palace now and do what when we get there loot the wine cellar we swear our allegiance to Lord Rahl Lord Rahl be dead if he be the last of his bloodline then our Agiels would have lose their power if and when the new Lord Rahl should claim the throne we will decide if he be worthy of our service until then who well to bring order to the territory than the Mord Sith I 've call for a meeting of all our sister at the Temple of Jandralyn we leave today when do you become queen I must have miss the coronation I demand an honorable death it be my right as a Mord Sith you deserve no honor you will stay alive and serve I do anybody else have a problem track come from down here what in the name of the spirit it be as I fear the creature escape from the Underworld it be a screeling like the nursery rhyme the screeling be loose the Keeper may win his assassin have come to rip off your skin if I remember right the poem say the only way to kill it be to hack it into piece Richard try hack it with the Sword of Truth it do not even seem to hurt the creature if we can not kill it we will find it and trap it our problem be far great than one nasty monster this crack in the earth it be a tear in the veil that separate the Underworld from the World of the living as long as it be open there be no way to prevent the Keeper of the Underworld the great enemy of all that walk breathe and grow in the light from send his minion to bring death to every live thing I fear the screeling be but the vanguard how could this have happen in all my year as a Wizard I have only know one form of magic strong enough to tear the veil the Power of Orden this happen when I kill Rahl when the Boxes of Orden explode Wizard 's Second Rule the great harm can come from the good intention well if I do this I will find a way to undo it the only way I know of to close the rift be the way the Creator seal the Underworld at the beginning of time the Stone of Tears he who possess the Stone would be able to repair the veil then we will find it the Stone have be lose for century beyond count many have give their life search for it if anyone can find it the Seeker can Kahlan I share your faith in Richard but the veil be delicate in the time it take to find one tiny Stone amid all the rock and mountain of creation crack like this could appear anywhere spread and splinter in all direction and then there would be nothing to prevent the Keeper from wage war on the World of the Living Seeker D'Harans soldier be in the town they be demand to see you Darken Rahl be dead the war be over Lay down your arm or you will feel my Sword we have not come to fight my Lord Master Rahl guide we Master Rahl protect we in your light we thrive in your wisdom we be humble we live only to serve our life be yours I be bear into the service of Darken Rahl 's father Lord Panis Rahl some call he a tyrant but in his time there be peace and order throughout the territory he take pride in his first bear son but as the boy grow old the father come to see the darkness in his son 's heart and his love for the dark way of sorcery the father begin to fear for the future of his kingdom when he learn of a Prophecy that say he would sire another son one who would kill his black hearted old brother Panis set out to ensure the truth of that Prophecy he father a child with a young woman whose bloodline be as powerful as his own Tarralyn Zorander that be a lie my daughter would never have lain with Panis Rahl yes Wizard Panis know this too which be why he woo Tarralyn in the guise of a young shepherd in this form he win her heart and conceive a child with her but in his pride my master make a foolish mistake he boast to Darken Rahl that the son prophesy to kill he would soon be bear in a rage Darken Rahl slew his own father and command I to dispose of the body but I convince Panis Rahl 's most faithful Mord Sith to revive he with the Breath of Life then kill she to protect the secret while Panis go into hiding I dispatch a rider to Tarralyn 's father to warn he that Darken Rahl have order the death of all first bear son of Brennidon where the Prophecy say the child would be bear I never know who send I that message and we never know if you receive this be some sort of trap it be no trap my Lord I have carry this secret for 24 year wait for the day that the Prophecy might be fulfil so that I could pledge my loyalty to you and to escort you back to the People 's Palace to assume your rightful place on the throne if you do not believe I order your confessor to do what she must to verify my word there be no need he be tell the truth Tighter yes mistress be there anything else I can do to please you I be sure there be when we have more time Lord Rahl scrub the floor Triana I would 've think that be beneath your station you be alive no not alive but still your master and I need you to perform a special task for I and for the one I serve Lord Rahl serve no man not a man Triana but we all have our master Mine be the Keeper of the Underworld and when he conquer all life those who stand by he will be reward if my Lord follow the Keeper then so do I but Cara have take command Cara help the Seeker to kill I she can not be trust which be why before you begin this special task I have for you you and your sister must destroy she how could I have be so consume by the acquisition of magic and power that I neglect to protect my own daughter Zedd I be sorry listen to I thinking of myself when you 've just learn that the great tyrant you fight so hard to kill be your on brother no he be not Richard I know this be hard to accept but Kahlan I be not challenge the word of the Mother Confessor here but blood be not what make somebody family I do not share blood with George and Mary Cypher but they will always be my parent now Zedd do you have any idea where we can pick up the trail of the Stone of Tears if there be a clue it be to be find in the ancient volume at the Wizard 's Keep in Aydindril go find what you can Kahlan stay here call the people of the town inside board up every window and doorway what about you the screeling be still out there I be go to hunt it down and kill it you say you and your man will follow I to the death my Lord maybe with a few more sword we can hack this thing to piece and then we be go to the People 's Palace you be go to proclaim yourself the new Lord Rahl you say it yourself our problem be a lot big than one monster with the veil tear the Keeper will wage war on the World of the living and if we have to fight that war we could use an army behind we I must warn you to expect violent opposition my Lord what be you talk about my man and I alone bear the secret to your parentage many D'Harans will not easily accept your claim to the throne in order to win the allegiance of the great number I recommend you immediately execute every member of the Third Battalion I be not go to kill my own man they be D'Harans my Lord if they be to follow you they must fear you I will find a way to deal with they right now we be go to kill a screele wolf that be no wolf since the custom have be break we will not give she an honorable death we will leave she to that shrieking creature or the townspeople whoever get her first the work of the screeling my Lord we will find he before he kill again what be that Rachel Martha protect your daughter Mother Mama Sarah no mercy Trimack forgive I Lord Rahl I have fail to protect you Seeker why be you do marching with these dog call off your man and I will call off mine Put down your weapon stand down I be Morwyn Bryer leader of the resistance in this valley we get word the Dragon Corps be march on Ehrengard and gather as fast as we could but they 've already leave a trail of slaughter man woman and child those people be kill by a screeling escape from the Underworld a screele these man be help I track it they say the Seeker be wise but only a fool would trust D'Harans you will address Lord Rahl with respect Lord Rahl it be not what you think the Seeker have take on the title of his great enemy a title he be bear to we fight to trade Rahls you fight for your freedom and you win it the war against the D'Harans be over but we be fight a new war now against an even more powerful enemy and if we stand together you expect we to fight shoulder to shoulder with the butcher who massacre our friend and defile our daughter Rebel coward any man here who raise a weapon against another will die by my sword it be Ehrengard the screeling must have go back to the town go protect your family let us move we save as many as we could but they get away with seven girl include Rachel we will get they back we be go after the Mord Sith my Lord we come here to escort the new Lord Rahl to the People 's Palace not save a few little girl you know what will happen to those girl Torture Death to those who will not break that be how they become Mord Sith how it have always be so they can serve the Lord Rahl and if you truly be he you would not pity they you would know that some day you will need to use they that be not how thing be go to be anymore maybe old Trimack be wrong maybe this man be too soft hearted to lead D'Hara Anyone else wanna question my order the Mord Sith temple be abandon Lord Rahl we find this one in a gully Cara Lord Rahl you 've certainly come up in the world where be the child what child the girl your sister take from Ehrengard if any girl be take my sister must have do it after they beat I and leave I to die I will get the truth out of her you can tell she be lie their training make the Mord Sith hard to read but I will find out she be the one who help I kill Darken Rahl whatever she do she do to save her own skin Richard we can not trust she I be not tell you to trust her I be tell you to trust I you be go to help we find your sister if you help I kill they do not be scare the Seeker and the Confessor will save we I say no talk no it be my fault punish I since you be so eager I do not see why we could not begin with your training right now Triana I get your message what be so important how about a treasonous Dragon Corps squadron escort none other than the Seeker to the People 's Palace to proclaim he the new Lord Rahl I think that might interest you that way wait if they go that way they take the girl to the Drowning Cave Drowning Cave during the rain the river flood it uncooperative trainee be leave there just before a storm Charming in the dry season you can get in but only through a high narrow canyon but once you be in there be no other way out it be a trap and I be sure it be just a coincidence that a squadron of the Third Battalion have be camp in the meadow just south of the cave Richard maybe this be their plan all along lure you into an ambush because they know you would do anything to save the child yes the Seeker 's kind heartedness be legendary if water flow into the cave it have to flow out somewhere there be an aquifer that empty into the marsh but it be barely big enough to crawl through and anybody who try would be greet by Mord Sith as soon as they come through the other side we can draw most of the Mord Sith out of the cave if we stage an attack through the canyon Richard that be exactly what they want that be what we will give they while you go through the aquifer and rescue the girl you will show she the way anybody who march into that canyon will be outnumber and pin down they will be slaughter Death mean nothing to we Lord Rahl we will do whatever you command hello Zeddicus what bring the great Shota so far from Agaden Reach the great Zeddicus what else a personal visit to an old friend if you be look for answer I do not have any yet I be on my way to Aydindril in search of they I 've already have a vision of exactly what you will discover in Aydindril a passage in the Seventh Codex of Sandragon will direct you to the hiding place of the Stone of Tears I could not have hope for well news tell I what the passage say so I can relay it to the Seeker yes we be all rely on the Seeker but not Richard Rahl it be write in the Halls of Prophecy that Richard Rahl will fail in his quest to defeat the Keeper Richard put no faith in Prophecy he will defeat the Keeper just as he defeat Darken Rahl yes he do defeat Darken Rahl exactly as the Prophecies predict but now the Prophecy say he will fail you can not pick or choose which prophecy you want to believe in Zeddicus so I should throw up my hand give up no the Prophecy be fork it can be avoid but if the World of the living be to be save you must name a new Seeker what kind of trick be this Richard be the one true Seeker be you speak now as a Wizard of the First Order or as his grandfather three sign will come before you First Richard will deny that which give he power Second he will embrace the one in red and finally he will bear the mark of the one who will destroy all of life when you 've see these three sign you will know that I have speak the truth and if you do not then do what must be do the Keeper will win and the World of the living will be devour by the Realm of Death where be the Seeker have your new Lord Rahl abandon you already give we the girl and we will let you live it be you and your man who will die here today Halt traitor slaughter they all for D'Hara and Lord Rahl this way give I your hand I do not know exactly what you do to make Richard trust you but if this be some sort of trick I will kill you hello sister I 've bring you a prize the Mother Confessor Kahlan I know you would come we have to go fast help I get they out of here I do not come for the child this belong to I thank you Seeker I shudder to think what would have happen if you be not here you should thank these man too they fight together to help save Rachel and the other girl it would have be an honor to die for Lord Rahl my man and I fight for the Seeker not Lord Rahl War be easy it be peace that will break your heart Zedd why be you back so soon I run into our old friend Shota what do she want Zedd be something wrong hey you wanna rip somebody 's head off take mine Unh Zedd now seek out the abbot of the Cloister of Ulrich for he keep the secret of the Stone close to his heart these be the word write in Codex Ulrich be in the opposite direction of the People 's Palace I be not go to the People 's Palace but I think I be not claim the throne you be deny that which would give you power what be important right now be find the Stone of Tears and close the rift Richard the Stone be a very small object in a very large world think how much more ground you could cover with the army of D'Hara under your command even if an army could help we how many would I have to kill to unite the D'Harans how long would it take while the Keeper grow strong and think of the thousand who see their brother and son die fight the House of Rahl would they follow I if I claim the title of the tyrant they despise or would I become the same enemy I would just defeat you could do thing differently today you convince enemy to fight side by side a few man against other follower of Rahl who still want to kill I if people want to follow I because they believe in what I be fight for I will lead they but I be not crown myself king I be not Lord Rahl I be Richard Cypher I be the Seeker and you be the Mother Confessor Zedd and I will see you safely to Aydindril and then we will hunt for the Stone and when it be over I will come back for you Richard I do not like it the two of you alone three a Mord Sith serve Lord Rahl you do not strike I as a type of person who like to serve anybody and I be not accept the title Lord Rahl if you be foolish enough to turn down the throne of D'Hara then you need I all the more all right Richard twice now she be prove herself to I I can use she we well say our goodbye I 've get a long journey embrace the one in red what nothing Aydindril seventy league over that ridge I 've be think you say yourself the most important thing right now be find the Stone of Tears I should be help you do that what about Aydindril I will get there when all this be over but as long as you be still the Seeker you need your confessor by your side what do you want to give you fair warning we be brother after all you be no brother to I you 've already kill I once you can not kill I again you believe you be fight for peace for freedom but how many have you kill in this fruitless quest already how many will you kill tomorrow everything you do try to defeat my master only make he strong you believe you be serve life brother but the truth be you be for the Keeper Richard you all right I be fine just a bad dream well it be over now what be this it be the Mark of the Keeper the prophecy say that the seeker will defeat darken rahl thank to the seeker that monster be dead and rot for all eternity in the underworld Kneel before the keeper forgive I master I have fail you no you have succeed exactly as I intend it be a tear in the veil that separate the underworld from the living this happen when I kill rahl as long as it be open there be no way to prevent the keeper of the underworld from send his minion to bring death to every live thing the only way to close the rift be the way the creator seal the underworld the stone of tear we will find it seek out the abbot of ulrich for he keep the secret of the stone close to his heart she be the one who help I kill darken rahl she do it to save her own skin if you be foolish enough to turn down the throne of d'hara then you need I all the more if this be some sort of trick I will kill you Mark of the keeper the one who would destroy all life Richard cypher you be the true seeker Watch subtitle tv show online for free

if richard trust cara I suppose we will have to learn to as well do it hurt it be nothing the spirit of the tyrant you kill come back from the grave and burn the mark of the keeper in your chest it be not nothing richard I wish I know what it mean what we do know be that we need to seal the rift between this world and the underworld and to do that we need to find the stone of tear and to find the stone we need to get to the abbot of ulrich it must have burn at least three month ago these weed be at least that old D'harans do this then where be the corpse if the abbot be not here then we 've come a long way for nothing if d'harans do this and they do not kill the monk where would they have take they from here they would have be take to tothrayne what be tothrayne a death camp no please no I have a son the war be over I do not want to die move the fast you get this load the fast you will get your reward General why be we still execute prisoner the war be over we should be get far away from this place you 've hear the report of reprisal against d'harans the good way to ensure there be no reprisal for what be be do here be to make certain that no one live to tell the tale do not

reason that we call he the butcher if we have not follow his order it would 've be our neck in noose it may still be but that be for the mother confessor to decide lock they in the cell we come here for the abbot he be dead there be no reason for we to stay look at these people they be sick they be scared they have no place to go we can not just leave they here there be already enough sickness in this place let us bury these body before it get any bad Lord rahl you serve I well in life general it be my hope that you will do the same for the keeper now that you be dead I do not understand it be quite simple the keeper of the underworld want to make you an offer those of you that be well enough to travel be free to leave but those of you that be not we will be make a camp just outside the prison if these prisoner be go to gain their strength back we be go to have to feed they something more substantial than d'haran gruel should we draw they warm bath do you know of anyone head in the direction of deerfork the dragon corp wipe out deerfork month ago but that be my father 's village we will try to find out where the survivor have relocate Deerfork be a resistance stronghold no one would 've be leave alive my father be not a resistance fighter he be just a locksmith that would 've make no difference to the dragon corps where will we go the rest of my family die here I be so sorry for your loss but you need to be strong for your son we will see what we can find out about your father you should not give she false hope it be not so long ago that you serve the one who cause all this misery at least try to show some compassion come with I I check the store room there be barely enough to feed the rat how can there be this many people with no food when the war end supply shipment stop what food there be go to the guard the d'harans would soon put a knife in our belly than a hot meal I be send cara out to get provision hopefully there will be enough for everyone move everyone we would have more if we do not have so many mouth to feed the d'harans will be bring to justice but we be not go to starve they to get it yes mother confessor I need a horse we need the horse to get provision you can bury he outside with the other I be not bury my brother alongside the d'harans who kill he he should be lay to rest beside our mother and father we be go to need fresh water my village be half a day 's ride I will have the horse back to you by morning check on the sister do it quickly I be so sorry for your loss Seeker I hear you be look for abbot henry I be a member of his order we need to confide in you a great secret there be be a tear in the veil between this world and the underworld the keeper be wage war on the land of the living he be use the rift to send horrible creature into our world and the only way to close this rift be for we to find the stone of tear we be tell that abbot henry have knowledge of the secret location of the stone the abbot of our order always wear a locket it have a rose inscribe on its face and it be pass down from abbot to abbot Shota say the abbot would keep the secret close to his heart the d'harans take the locket when they bring we to this awful place we live in peace until the d'harans come Seize the abbot what be this what be the meaning of this you have no authority here there be no need for this we be man of peace no no please please that be sacred anything take from the abbot would 've be keep with the valuable we take from the other prisoner it be the butcher 's plan to escape with the treasure to disappear and use it to make new life for himself and his man now the treasure can help we give the prisoner their life back open it I 've see he before a man come to the stable ask for a horse so he could take his brother to be bury apparently he take the treasure instead and you believe his story the confessor tell I I have to show more compassion be you say this be my fault yes it do not matter whose fault it be we need to find he I come to give they some food do you see who do this it be the butcher he be come back from the grave quickly everyone get inside this way be it true what they be say that the butcher kill those people I do not know but you will be safe inside the prison we need to set up a guard through the night make sure no one get in or out I can take first watch keep the door lock keep everyone inside that will not stop he I get to see what the butcher be capable of when he kill my friend if he have come back to take his revenge he will not stop until he be kill we all whoever it be we will keep they out but just in case I 've look everywhere there be no sign of whoever murder these man be it possible the rumor be true the butcher be come back from the grave like darken rahl do Darken rahl be just a spirit spirit do not have body they can not pick up knife and slaughter people well we be go to find who do in the meantime I need you to find the man who steal the abbot 's locket he can not have get far I do not want he torture or kill bring he back alive I will do my good if this butcher 's escape from the grave I would like to see it for myself someone dig he up no he claw his way out so do the rest of the d'harans we bury could this be the work of the keeper Darken rahl it be possible who else could bring the dead back to life the mord sith Cara 's with we now why would she come all this way to resurrect some d'haran with the breath of life she serve rahl and fight side by side with the d'harans for year Cara help I defeat rahl that should earn she some trust whoever do this however it happen we have a big problem how do you kill something that be already dead we have to find they first I be not here to harm you who be you I be abbot henry the d'harans tell we that you have be hang after the d'harans execute I I awake in the underworld in a pit of unimaginable suffering I be greet by darken rahl himself Rahl he tell I that the keeper wish to make I an offer he would allow I to return to the land of the living but he demand an awful price in exchange for let I live again I have to agree to kill for the keeper he make you a banele baneling be dead soul who selfishly bargain for a second life in exchange for kill other I think they be just a legend so do I but it seem the keeper be use the tear in the veil to give the dead a chance to return to the world of the living I guess the butcher and his man accept his offer so can anyone who die become a banele maybe not maybe only in place like tothrayne the veil between our world and the underworld be weak in place of great death the rift be grow if we do not close it soon the keeper could send baneling back anywhere we need to find the stone of tear to close the rift in the veil Brother bertrand tell we that the secret of the stone be inside your locket yes that be why I have to take the keeper 's offer to reclaim the locket and ensure the stone 's location be not lose forever well we be try to find the locket right now what be wrong I have not fulfil my end of the keeper 's bargain I have not kill anyone yet I be be call back to the underworld tell we what we need to do with the locket I spend year learn the ritual I would need to pass on to you there be simply not enough time well we have to buy you time how you have to kill someone I be not sure I can do this you will be kill a d'haran Guilty of horrible crime it may be the only way to defeat the keeper they be already dead we have to find someone else for he to kill there be no time you must listen to I the locket contain a runescriber the magic imprint a rune onto the palm of the one who open it you must take the rune to the province of pamorah the rune be the key that will open the what about I do not I get any oh there be plenty to go around sorry to interrupt I know you be mourn the loss of your brother we all grieve in our own way where be the treasure I be not afraid of you do you know what horrible thing they do to I at tothrayne intimately I do not break when they put I on the rack or when they throw I in the drown pool or when they spin I on the wheel of pain torture I all you want you will be waste your time oh I do not want to torture you I have other way of loosen your tongue after the awful way they treat you in that place I can see why you would hire those woman to bring you some comfort but I will do thing to you those woman can not even imagine many know of a mord sith 's ability to bring pain but few know we be equally skilled at bring pleasure First

that thing you be go to do and that other thing sound good too all right all right just the first thing then the rune be the key but a key to what we have no idea what to do with it once we get there we have a big problem the butcher and his man be out somewhere and they need to kill but who kill these man the butcher would not bother with a locked cell when there be much easy prey within these wall who else would want they dead I be sure any prisoner would want revenge against the d'harans but only one of they have key to the cell who a prisoner a resistance fighter find he what be stop these dead d'harans from take the keeper 's deal and become baneling themselves you say baneling be creature of the flesh when their soul return to this world they need a body what be you think we burn they zedd Richard this be what you be look for do you open this answer I yes some strange ink come out and do this what you 've be mark by powerful magic boy we have to take he with we to pamorah I be not go anywhere with you take he to kahlan have her confess he no we do not know how the confessor 's touch will affect the rune 's magic seem this be worth quite a bit to you at least as much as the treasure you want I to go with you to this pamorah it will cost you you be not get the treasure well then I guess I be not go anywhere and this hand go where I go not if I cut it off when do we leave lock he in the warden 's office until we deal with the baneling you know this would be a good place for you to keep up your end of our bargain hey hey hey hey our thief will not be go anywhere without we you bring he back without a scratch how would you manage that I have other method what kind of method well however you do it it be good work do you expect anything less I be just glad to have you on our side maybe you can tell zedd and kahlan that they can stop sleep with weapon under their pillow the d'haran guard be kill on your watch I give you key to the cell and a weapon you want

they be still wait for the bearer of the rune to arrive to make sure no one get the stone where be this tomb in a cemetery to the south but go anywhere near it mean certain death I wonder where Flynn 's family be I never ask he it be not your fault this happen we take he with we because we need he now he will spend the rest of his life desperately long for someone he will never see again well maybe after Pamorah no no Flynn will be a distraction my whole life I want to see the world and now that I be out here I do not understand any of it I will teach you Kahlan say I have to go to a place call Aydindril to be train I will come with you she say you can not that you have something more important to do in Pamorah with Richard I do not want to go anywhere without you then you will get your wish how it be late we all need some sleep my mistress be cold I be go to get some more wood for the fire maybe Flynn and I can get marry I be sorry Annabelle that be not go to happen but he love I and I love he and in the book I 've read it be not the same with Confessors we serve a high purpose but our gift make the kind of romance you 've read about impossible so you can not get marry a Confessor take a mate but not for love to continue our line and there be not very many of we leave I think you and I may be the only one so one day when you be ready you will take a suitable mate what make a mate suitable well uh he should be strong noble and brave a leader so Richard 's your mate then no I love Richard but if he and I be to be together in that way he would become confess but he already love you Richard have an important mission only he can carry out if he be confess his love for I would be all consume it would distract he so much he would go mad and he could not complete his quest so you can never be with someone you love once you start your training and see how important our work be you will understand that it make up for the thing we can not have the sorcerer 's man they be come keep her safe come on what be you do grant your wish there be no one here Flynn they be go and so be the horse you be bleed I have to make it look real I fool they so that we could get away be not that what you want do it hurt for you nothing hurt when I be in the tower the servant use to secretly bring I book to read have you ever hear the story of Rosalind and Palomar yeah everybody know that story she save he from the dragon and then they sail away on the ocean together you remind I of Palomar at least the way I imagine he I would save you from a dragon would you take I to see the ocean I would take you anywhere what this rune be the key to find the Stone of Tears unless Richard have it the Keeper will destroy all life include yours maybe we should go back how do you know what they tell you be true my father tell I there be nothing but war and wickedness in this world that be a lie you be proof of that and even if what they be say be true I would rather die with you than be lock in another tower without you I should 've separate they right away he be comfort a scared girl it would have be cruel she would have be safe we will find they look the track split one horse go north the other east he be try to make it hard for we to follow he Clever not clever enough these track be deep the horse that go that way be not carry any weight Hungry wait here you know what we do with thief around here show they mercy Flynn well two thief maybe you 've get something to bargain with stay away from her command I confessor hey stop they the only way to kill baneling be to burn they we will need oil and torch why not just use Wizard 's Fire I do not think that would be wise it be because I be a Mord Sith be not it you think if you use your magic I will turn it against you I 've have chance before with the Seeker and Confessor nearby and now you know where the tomb be do you honestly think that be why I 've follow Richard all this way in the hope that he would send I here with you alone so that I could find a way to steal the stone for myself probably not but what be at stake be far too important to rely on probability I do not believe you have the luxury of caution get they I think that be all of they for now but this be a place of death other may crawl out of the earth to replace they we should get Flynn back here with the rune as quickly as we can we be you sure you can trust I no but I do not have the luxury of caution Flynn Annabelle I know this be hard for you but we have to get move we 've lose enough time as it be if you do not leave my friend will make you leave Richard they be all confess let us go what be wrong I know Richard and Kahlan Sooner or later they will catch we Kahlan no Richard Richard Richard Mistress how can I serve you be you hurt I be fine let us go I will come with you Mistress everything he do be to save life he save yours and you 've destroy he I be sorry Kahlan but you do not leave I a choice and you leave I no choice I will not let you kill she kill I it be the only way to release I from Confession but do not worry Mistress I will protect you Richard I do not want to fight you then put down your weapon I will get the horse what be you do do not hurt he let he go you will order both of these man to come with I to Pamorah right now or I will kill he you would not hurt he you need the rune on his hand I need he in Pamorah if he do not go he be of no use to I if we go with you and Flynn get you your stone will you let we be together you have my word it be a trap she will try to kill you the first chance she get Richard I know you be confess to she but you know I I be not a liar no she be not Put your sword down we be go with her she say she would order Flynn to go to Pamorah with we if I let they live and you agree to that I have to either Richard be go to kill I or I be go to kill he I need Zedd no Flynn you promise you lie to I I have to if the Keeper win everyone will die I need the Seeker to fight he and seal the rift in the Underworld I need you to be you Richard Annabelle no do not kill she I love she I love she as much as I ever love you I know you Kahlan you do not want to murder the last confessor I never ask to be a confessor I never ask to be lock in a tower I just want to be like everyone else if there be any other way maybe there be the sorcerer 's quillion if we can get it we can use it to drain Annabelle 's power would Richard and Flynn be release I doubt it be ever be try but in theory they should not be bind by magic she herself no long possess Kahlan if you love I you will give it a try he be only say that because he be be confess confess or not Richard would do anything to save a life we have to get the stone first and then we will go to the sorcerer 's cave and get his quillion I do not believe what I be hear you want we to risk everything our life Richard 's life to save she if you do not have the stomach to kill she I will I seem to remember Richard go to great length to save your life and if it do not release he then I will do what need to be do it be another locket maybe there ' another rune inside it or maybe it hold the Stone of Tears the Seeker should be the one to open it when he be release from confession not when he be this unpredictable you get what you come for we need to go after the quillion he can still fight he would do anything to save her life we both know Richard can not be rely upon right now then Cara and I will just have to take care of the sorcerer ourselves be you sure any sorcerer as powerful as Lorcus be go to be able to see right through we if we be not convince if you insist this will hurt just do it I have something the sorcerer would be very interested in surrender your weapon go ahead take it I know the power of the Agiel Lay it down yourself and the other one now summon your sorcerer or I take my merchandise elsewhere and what would a Mord Sith expect in return for her merchandise a thousand gold piece why would I pay such a price Rumor have it you be in the market for Confessor power this be the Mother Confessor I sincerely doubt you would be make a well offer she be no use to I dead she be not dead just compliant how do I know that examine she yourself command I confessor call off your guard stop do not harm they give I the quillion you spare my life even when your friend tell you not to you can thank I if this work if it do you will be the last confessor you will have to take a mate yes someday I will Richard would make a good father for a confessor would not he Annabelle if he be confess to I you can not hurt he and he could give you a child and then when you take my magic he will be release will not he yes but that be not the way that Kahlan maybe you should consider what she be suggest if something be to happen to you then the race of Confessors would be no long I want to do something for you while I be still a confessor please but I do not love she I love you this will make I very happy go to her and love she as you would love I Kahlan it be all right it be all right Richard Richard what be you think about please you because your mistress order you to yes you really love she do not you with all my heart do I do something wrong no you do not do anything wrong but my mistress command I to I know I guess I would not want to give myself to Flynn like that if he be think about somebody else it be not just that Richard would never use magic to force someone to act against their will but it be not really against his will if he be not confess he would want to but he be confess and I be not prepared to make that decision for he or to make he a father without his blessing but for Confessors be not it always like that that be why we do not take man we love as mate it be kind of like be lock in a tower be not it we should get start if this work I can get marry one day I hope you will but Flynn will not love I anymore he be just the first one you meet there will be other man but what if he be the only one that I will ever love Annabelle be you all right it do not work I be not confess anymore I be just make sure she be all right Richard we will see you safely hom your father 's castle be rightfully yours now thank you but uh I think I 've spend enough of my life there I want to see the world where we be go will not be

blood spill all the victory win and what have it get we only more battle and more blood the Midlands be a bloody place if you do not fight even to protect yourself how have you survive we be healer for thousand of year people have come to we with their sick and injure and so we be respect and leave to live in peace you be not at peace anymore no with the passing of Darken Rahl these land turn to chaos a warlord name Caldor come across the mountain and capture our village those of we who escape come together in the wood and the slaver Caldor 's man when they realize we would not fight they come after we to force we to serve their master your camp be too vulnerable we see some cave at the top of that ridge you would be safe there we could escort you I know you be try to help but we 've always be all right on our own May the spirit be with you they do not want our help and we need to get back to Kahlan and Zedd I do not like leave those people by themselves they have a right to follow their own belief the Seeker can not save everyone that be strange it be give we a new bearing which way be it point back the way we come to the Minders ' camp Seeker please do not leave Caldor 's man will be back teach I how to fight so that I may defend my people what about your belief my mother do not speak for all of we some of we think the old way do not make sense anymore when Caldor 's fighter attack our village my father stand in front of they and he pray for their spirit but they slit his throat anyway I be sorry I do not want your sympathy I want you to teach I to fight I be not ask you to do anything you do not choose to do but if you want to join Kur and learn to fight we will stay and teach you Kur fighting be not the way we will go to the cave we will barricade ourselves we will be safe there for how long till they starve we burn we out who will fight with I you would all rather stick to the old belief watch we get cut down and drag away until there be nobody leave I will fight no Veta you know the Creator 's will and I also know I do not want to die or be a slave do you you Lot will stay here with I and Kahlan Roga will you let Zedd and Cara go with you to the cave and protect you until these people be ready to protect you themselves we need to ask you something do you know anything about the Stone of Tears of course we know of it it be in our prayer today the compass we be follow shift its bearing to your encampment do you have the Stone no we think the Stone have be lose forever for all our sake I hope it have not do not we need well weapon uh these stave will do fine for now the slaver have sword and battle axis what can we do with these I use to be a trail guide on the other side of the Boundary sometimes there be bandit in the wood and all I have be a staff to fight they off with nobody I guide through the wood ever lose a farthe one two three strike you have to give it more than that one two three strike Better but even hard you be fight for the life of the people you love one two three strike Kur Kur answer I I know no good would come of this I be sorry what be it Zedd I believe these people be under a bind spell a very ancient and very powerful magic they be fight when they collapse yes this be the first time they 've ever raise a weapon against an opponent that may be what cause the spell to strike they down I do not understand the Wizards of long ago create the bind spell as a way of rein in the powerful force that burn inside we Lust anger envy violence it could be that this spell be put on the Minders to prevent they from raise their weapon if the magic be thousand of year old how could it be affect these people now some spell do not die with those on whom they be cast they be intend to be pass down through the blood which may explain your people 's aversion to fight we choose not to fight because we love the Creator and her work not because of a a spell whatever the reason I think I can draw the magic into my own body but heal all of they will drain I of my power it may take day for I to recover and who know what the consequence will be what do you mean the ancient Wizards be man of great wisdom they do not cast powerful spell for no reason we have no way of know what will happen to they or I if I remove the bind spell we have to risk it thank the Creator and the Wizard do not thank I yet it be our turn to help you Wizard I will take you back to the cave can we fight again now how can you even ask you see the price you pay but the spell have be lift Kur if you fight again and something happen the Wizard will not have the strength to heal you if we do not learn to fight we die anyway you will keep teach we will not you this be not a game your enemy be not go to just stand there while you poke at he he be go to try to kill you you have to try and kill he first hesitate and die I bring you dinner Quick little bastard but not quick enough thank you but we never eat anything that be be kill actually I find they by the side of the road where they die a natural peaceful death Cara we be Roga 's guest there be no sense to this it be one thing not to kill another person but you have to eat I see some winterberry grow along the path down below the rock we will gather some go after they they do not want our help as long as we be with they I be not go to allow any more of they to be kill go Hungry not particularly do not you like winterberry maybe stuff inside a crisply roasted suckling pig try one you may be surprise good right Roga take a message to Caldor leave the Minders alone I will not let you hurt he I be just go to teach he a lesson yes the same lesson you 've both be teach all your life that violence will help you do what you want I be through with you go in peace serve the Creator and she will reward you good work we will start again at first light come on Seeker draw your sword a good soldier know when to rest Caldor 's man be not rest I want to test myself against a real fighter with a real weapon you be not scared of I be you hesitate and die that be what you teach we right you 've be pay attention do not go so easy on I nice move but know when your opponent have a well one Richard what be you do what do it look like I be teach he to fight you almost kill he he will never learn to defend himself until he be face someone who be try to hurt he Richard you just start train he two day ago I know what I be do Kahlan do not get in my way do he hurt the boy mostly just scare the wit out of he but there be an anger in Richard 's eye I have never see before it be bitter and harsh maybe you be just upset because Richard raise his voice at you you be not there have you see what happen you would know something be wrong the Sword be glow glowing do that mean something the magic of the Sword be fuel by the Seeker 's anger and with it he be able to fight with the strength of many man but the Sword only glow when the Seeker 's anger turn to rage he be out of control could this have something to do with remove the bind spell from the Minders I do not know but I need to see he you be ready for what I only plan to teach you how to defend yourself against the slaver but you be well fighter than I expect you to be we be go to take your village back from Caldor be I wrong about you be you afraid to take back what be yours no there be nothing we want more but to fight Caldor we need well weapon the Wizard can make they for we you will not always have a Wizard to help you we will get they ourselves how if it be not for Kur we could all be dead Kur do not hesitate he do what have to be do grab a weapon it be time to go you be raise with the belief that no man 's life be worth more than another 's but I tell you today the enemy we will face be not man they be the monster who hold your father and force he to watch while they violate your mother they be the demon who force hot coal down your brother 's throat they be the ghoul who drag your sister away and force she to live in slavery humiliation and despair do not fight the rage let it hold you in its grip let it guide the deadly sweep of your sword because it be the torch of rage that will guide your way to victory this be where he be train the Minders the slaver must have take they they be not take not with Richard to protect they then where have they go this be for my father follow they into the forest hunt they down and kill they all our village have be desecrate Creator forgive those who do this Tamra I never think I would see you again in the this world spirit be thank the spirit have abandon we never Tamra never she be take slave by Caldor 's man when they attack our village you can not imagine what I see the killing the blood and it be minder do it Veta and Kur slash man to the ground my son Killing Man after man his clothe be soak with their blood it be the Seeker who lead they to do this Th be not Richard there be magic at work here Caldor 's man try to run but the Seeker kill they anyway maybe he think he have to these man be savage slaver and killer if Richard let they go they may have come back Kahlan Zedd what be it inscription write in an ancient Wizard 's tongue one I learn long ago there be more inside the temple we 've never know what they mean if they mean what I think they do then there be no telling what terrible thing Richard may be capable of find he bring he back here as quickly as you can cara if Richard be truly out of control then maybe only Mord Sith magic can stop he from use the Sword Caldor 's main camp all those tent there must be a hundred man that be a hundred more soul for we to send to the Keeper how do we fight that many we do not these be the man who kill our father we can not let they live we will not if we be not go to fight they then how we be go to burn they while they sleep be you all right I be fine Richard what do you want you need to go back to the village all of you we be not finish with Caldor More killing only serve the Keeper and everything we be fight against the Minders have their village back you 've teach they to defend themselves be not that enough no it be not let us move Richard you be not yourself Put down the Sword not until Caldor and every one of his man be dead now you can stand with we or you can fight against we I be not go to let you do this Richard no Cara Cara Cara Cara there be nothing I can do for her I do not have my power back yet you be healer you can help she maybe I should not what do the Creator give I the gift of healing so I could put a killer back in the fight only to kill again be not that a Mord Sith 's life one long kill you do not know anything about Cara and if you can save she but you let she die be not that the same as kill she yourself take she to my home how could I do it Zedd how could I raise the Sword to Kahlan nearly kill Cara how could I have slaughter all those slaver I have something to show you these writing tell the story of a bloodthirsty warlord who use dark magic to chain a clan of fierce warrior to his will 3 000 year ago through the chain flow a storm of bloodlust and rage and together the warlord and his warrior rampage through the Midlands leave death and destruction in their wake who be this warlord fight anyone and everyone he be mad for blood and power finally he be capture and behead on the spot where this temple now stand the great Wizard of that time fear that the warlord 's bloodthirsty man would become chain to another dark master put a bind spell on they that would cause they and their descendent to sicken and die if they ever again raise arm in violence those warrior be ancestor of the Minders and when you remove the bind spell they be free to fight again yes and free to become chain to another master I how why because Richard the madman that first put the spell on they be name Canton Rahl he be your ancestor we start with water the foundation of all element that be you to the water we add alum that be the Minders when I remove the bind spell the Minders become chain to your will but the water stay calm as long as you stay calm but then you add the magic of the Sword of Truth to the brew and that be the vinegar three element Richard each of they harmless on their own but together a catastrophe because now that we be chain together when I feel the rage so do the Minders yes then to protect the minder we need to break the chain maybe if I get far away from they I do not think that would work the chain seem to be like a Confessor 's magic which be break neither by time nor distance so whenever I pick up the Sword no matter where I be every time you use the Sword and lose yourself to your rage they will too then I need to learn to control the Sword again I do not know if it be possible the magic of the Sword may have become too potent but I will do what I can it seem so unlikely Zedd of all the clan in the Midlands I just happen to meet one that be magically chain to my bloodline nothing in this world just happen Richard the compass point we in their direction why the compass be suppose to guide the Seeker 's way maybe that mean more than just show we where to go you think there be something I need to do here to help I find the Stone maybe maybe there be something you need to learn about your ancestry about yourself who know maybe you be bring here to find an army to fight with Caldor 's man they be come always and again kill only bring more kill Zedd have your power return can you fight I could not incinerate a fly Cara 's hurt Zedd can not fight it be you and I and the Minders we train against dozen of man then you will need this no not after what I do to Cara we do not know if the Minders can fight without the Sword 's rage fuel their courage Zedd when I hold that Sword all I feel be hatred what happen if I use it in battle and the fury take control of I I can not trust myself with it anymore not yet anyway then what do we do my mother and the other minder still have the bind spell on they you know they can not fight they just have to look like they can halt the Minders want nothing more than to remain in their village and live in peace but if you force they to fight they will fight to the death your death it be your choice it be your fault Seeker these people be clever enough to know not to fight back until you come now we be here to take blood for blood you 've already taste the wrath of the Minders and now you be outnumber four to one if I do decide to let you live how do I know the moment we turn our back your peace love friend will not attack we I be the leader of this clan you have my word only a fool trust his enemy I know this woman Lord Caldor she be tell you the truth I would stake my life on that I accept your assurance but you have my word that if any of your clan attack one of my man I will be back with a thousand every one of you will die we need to restrain you so no one gets hurt while Richard and I work with the Sword I be sorry I hope you will not have to stay here for long what if the magic 's too strong what if you can not control it then I will not use the Sword again how will the Seeker complete his quest without the Sword of Truth let the power of the magic rise within you do not resist it I do not want to lose control the rage be part of you Richard fighting against it only make it strong what do you feel Anger at what everything that be no reason what be you angry at Darken Rahl you 've kill he you 've use that anger up what be you angry at the Keeper the Keeper do not drag you into this fight you release he what be you angry at lose my father and brother and everything I know in Hartland everybody have to grow up and leave home that be nothing for a man to moan about what be you angry at I can not be with the woman I love lot of people can not be with the one they love some of we have even lose our child and you do not see we fly into rage what be you angry at boy I be not your boy what be you angry at tell I Richard who drag you into this fight who be you angry at you now we be get somewhere all those year you know who I be and you say nothing you lie to I about be my grandfather you be not ready for the truth you take I out of Hartland you name I the Seeker you be the one who give I this damned Sword Richard no no he have to stop himself I almost kill you Zedd but you do not you be strong than the rage this time but you will master it as long as you have the courage to keep work at it it be yours Richard and only your if you want it try again that be it Richard Good now let it go you 've do well it be point due east the way we be go before it send we back to the Minders maybe I learn what I need to I think you have the hard people to break be always the one who be not afraid to die for their belief I think you would be especially difficult thank you fohelping save our village I hope the Creator be not too disappointed in we the next time you be about to use your Agiel I hope you will remember that we defeat a whole army without spill a raindrop 's worth of blood what be you think just daydream that be all you be actually try to lie to a confessor when will I learn I think I know Richard I 've watch he his whole life and only see the good in he until now there be only good in he it be the magic that be the trouble oh if it be only that simple just a few week ago we learn who his real father be a Rahl he be not raise by a Rahl he be raise by George Cypher the Rahl bloodline carry with it powerful magic and that magic be in Richard I be not sure until now Magic be not always pass from one generation to the next but the only way he could have become chain to the Minders be through the magic of the House of Rahl he be still Richard he be still the Seeker Kahlan there be a part of the Minders ' story I do not tell he Canton Rahl the man who first put the spell on the Minders be not always bloodthirsty he start out as a protector and benefactor to his people but then as his power grow he begin to fight and to kill and the more he kill the more the blood lust overtook he he go mad with it and now we know that darkness be in Richard but Richard learn to control the Sword he master his rage yes he control the Sword today but what about tomorrow Zedd behind you for the glory of D'Hara Command I confessor tell I why you attack we we have stand order to kill the Seeker maybe you have not get word the war 's over yes but there be a rumor among the officer corps that the Seeker be of the Rahl bloodline that he be next in line for the throne then the D'Harans should serve he not try to kill he my command officer General Grix want to claim the throne for himself he be try to eliminate anyone that would challenge he not only the Seeker but rival general in the D'Haran army as well only a Lord Rahl can rule the empire not some common foot soldier this General Grix do not sound very interested in the royal line of succession where can we find he he may command a legion but Bain be a man like any other he will be more open to compromise once he be lose someone close to his heart order the quad to deploy the first weapon in the General 's home village Norwood General Grix you have a visitor I have a message for you sir I be

you have assume the throne of D'Hara month ago the army would be help you in your quest instead of try to kill you if I have claim the throne I would not be on a quest to find the Stone of Tears I would be too busy killing and scheme to keep control of my empire sometimes ruthlessness be require of a leader Fear be the only thing that have ever unite D'Hara I would never try to get people to follow I by kill and terrorize they your sentiment be noble but impractical a true leader take power he do not ask his subject for permission first that be Darken Rahl 's way not mine now let us go find Grix we be too late what do you do what happen I cast a deafness spell so we could not hear the sound of the Whisperer which be the only reason we be still alive what about the villager they be

together she would not need to confess he to get he to do she bid he would sacrifice anything for her his mission even you you do not know the first thing about the Mother Confessor I know that Kahlan

legitimate heir to the empire someone of the Rahl bloodline you think you be go to train I you try that before and you fail I do not need to train you to control D'Hara whatever it be you be plan you

the good general be one of my most faithful servant the chaos he unleash after my demise send thousand of soul to this place I just offer to give he a second life a chance to continue his ruthless way as a baneling but he refuse he say his Mistress instruct he to turn down the Keeper 's generous offer do you know why because he say that she be go to use magic to place his spirit in your body for once our interest be align if what Grix here say be true then Denna and this sorcerer of hers have revive an ancient magic capable of steal any soul from the Underworld the Keeper can not allow anyone to hold this power he must have dominion over the dead you and your Keeper be afraid of her there be not much time Richard Soon Grix will be summon and there be not anything I can do to stop it once his spirit be inside your body you will be my guest here for eternity there be only one way to thwart Denna 's scheme accept my offer become a banele Return to your body before it be too late you be a fool if you think I be go to kill to serve the Keeper you 've already kill enough people to earn yourself a place of honor here what difference will a few more make I will not do the Keeper 's bidding you do the Keeper 's bidding every time you take a life the reason you kill do not make a difference you want to see your beloved Kahlan again do not you Kahlan will go on without I and so will Zedd

the creator 's light please rise Sister Brenna Sister Brenna 's weak heart finally give out but the radiant look of peace on her face can only mean she be with the Creator now thank you Sister Nicci could you please prepare the funeral pyre yes Prelate Prelate may I leave Sister Brenna 's hymn book with her she love it so of course Sister Ulicia this rash I 've see it before it be cause by a deadly poison from a rare vine call creep eld sister please excuse we I should have know well than to try and keep the Seeker of Truth in the dark I think Sister Brenna take her own life perhaps with that poison you mention why would she do such a thing many month ago I send Sister Brenna on a service mission when she return she say that during her time away she would become troubled in her heart she witness fear sickness famine starve child can not survive on the creator 's light Prelate that be what she tell I I be afraid she might do something like this then why do you tell everyone her heart give out the Sisters of the Light believe suicide be an offense to the Creator I do not want to dishonor she in front of the other how can you be sure someone do not poison her Richard you hear what the Prelate say Brenna be not well why would she kill herself during devotion as oppose to what kill herself during teatime you 've both have such a long journey Verna why do not you show Richard to his quarter your Wizard training can begin in the morning have a Sister ever take her life at the palace before Verna Sauventreen Sister Philomena Welcome back welcome back and you must be our new Wizard how terribly exciting I be not really a Wizard oh forgive I I see you put your hand up and think you be go to blast I with Wizard 's Fire be you all right we have so much to catch up on trust no one yes I be sure we do meet I tonight when moonbeam flood the sanctuary it be it be good to see you uh Richard how unfortunate that just as you return from one mission in the New World I be set off on another so many poor soul in need of the creator 's light you know a sister 's work be never do speak of a sister 's work I need to see Richard to his room Young Wizard may the Creator 's light illuminate your path the Prelate 's probably send she on a mission just to get rid of her your room I will be back in the morning to begin your training Good the soon we start the soon I can get out of here and get back to the New World be something wrong I miss Richard why because I love he and I be not use to be apart from he it be not necessary to feel pain over his absence do not you feel anything Mord Sith believe emotion must be govern sadness remorse love these feeling make you weak but anger loyalty pride these feeling make you powerful I can teach you how to control your emotion if you like I be not sure love make a person weak Cara then why be you sit on the ground weep over a sword thank you for your advice but uh I think I will be all right I hope Zedd be all right Zedd can handle himself I be sure he will be back soon can I help you with something Zeddicus you know exactly why I 've come yes because you realize that Richard Cypher will fail at his quest and someone very wise tell you that if you do not name a new Seeker the world will perish which in your blindness and your pride you choose to ignore be you just interested in gloating or do you have a candidate in mind as a matter of fact I do remember not just anyone can be the Seeker he must be courageous strong compassionate and above all relentless in the pursuit of truth fortunately I have glimpse just such a man in my vision come let I show he to you Shota if this turn out to be one of your trick it will be your last no trick a new Seeker be our only hope there he be who be you I be Sister Nicci I see you today with the Prelate yes she consider I one of her close adviser why do you ask I here to tell you a secret that could get I kill but you must know the truth what truth how old do you think I be by the reckoning of the world outside the Palace of the Prophets I be nearly 300 year old how be that possible the palace be spell for every day that pass in here ten day pass in the outside world if that be true then if I be here a month almost a year will go by for my friend yes and if your Wizard training take only a year ten year will pass on the outside and by that time your friend could be dead your quest could be meaningless the Keeper could have already destroy all life why do not anyone tell I this the Prelate believe you would not stay if you find out so she order the Sisters not to speak of it but you be tell I why because I do not believe it be right to keep you from pursue your quest by perpetrate a lie be the headache a lie too no I be afraid those be real what be you do show you your han the essence of your magic Sisters of the Light have the ability to sense it your han be the strong I 've ever feel it be what be be cause your pain and it be also why the Prelate be so intent on keep you here because I would die otherwise that be only part of it what she really want be to train the most powerful wizard in 3 000 year to be her disciple to fight her enemy you mean the Keeper no the Prelate want to stop you from pursue your quest why Prophecy it be write in the time of the tearing of the veil should the son of Brennidon seek the sacred stone he will find it only to deliver it to the enemy of light the Prelate believe the enemy of the light be the Keeper and that this prophecy mean you will fail in your quest to defeat he you do not agree some of we believe it be a pretense for hold you here and that the beloved leader of our order have become a zealot Sister Brenna think so she argue that we should tell you the truth but she never get the chance you believe the Prelate kill she Creeping elder kill quickly the Prelate greet I at the back of this room she do not get close enough to Brenna to deliver the poison all I know be that Sister Brenna speak out against the Prelate and now Brenna 's dead I have to get out of here be there a way to do that without the han kill I if you wear a rada'han it would suppress your power and in turn your headache do you have one no but the Prelate do she keep it lock up it may take I a few day before I have the chance but I will try to bring it for you a few day here be a month on the outside I will get it as soon as I can until then please do not let anyone know that we 've speak it could get I kill why do you lie to I I want the truth come with I in the time of the tearing of the veil should the son of Brennidon seek the sacred stone he will find it only to deliver it to the enemy of the light the Creator herself give we these prophecy to guide our action do the Creator herself tell you to lie to I no no that be my idea while I be look for you in the New World I learn a lot about you include how devoted you be to Kahlan and your grandfather so I send word in a Journey Book suggest the Prelate hide the truth about the time difference why because you have a great destiny Richard I believe people make their own destiny sometimes they be write for we our scholar have interpret this prophecy to mean that you would be bear in Brennidon and you be they say that this prophecy mean that you would defeat an evil tyrant and you do and now they say that this prophecy mean that if you continue search for the Stone of Tears you will find it but you will give it to the Keeper I would never do that and finally the last and most important prophecy our scholar have interpret this one to mean that the descendant of two powerful bloodline must fight a powerful new force after the Keeper be defeat that descendant be you even if that be true that battle will never happen if I do not defeat the Keeper first you must leave that quest to a new Seeker and prepare for your next challenge I be not go to let my life be rule by someone 's interpretation of some carving on a wall because of these carving I give up half my life just to bring you here and if I stay I be give up the love of my life the hard you study the fast you will learn to use your power and the soon you will get back to those you love what do we do with horse thief I be not a horse thief I be a blacksmith this be the man we 've spend the last month cross three river two mountain range and the great swamp of Mathragon to find this be the man I see in Shota 's vision then why be he skulk around our horse I be go to the stream to get some water for my forge when I notice one of your horse be favor a leg look if you do not get that pebble out of her hoof she will go lame he be tell the truth of course he be tell the truth he be the next Seeker of Truth so it be true then you know you would be the Seeker there be be a legend in my family for generation that someday one of our line would be name my mother be always sure it would be I do do Richard Cypher die no he be alive he just have to take a long journey we be not sure when he will come back this be the Book of Counted Shadows only a true Seeker can read it the truth of the word of the Book of Counted Shadows can only be insure by a Confessor sorry about your neck Leo Dane though the road will be long and the outcome unknown will you undertake this journey I will will you leave behind your friend and all that you have know I will and though the force of evil be swear to bring about your death still will you go on I will and will you accept the name of the Seeker I will then I First Wizard Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander so name you only in the hand of the Seeker will the compass guide the way to the Stone of Tears we head south can I give you a hand you will soon learn that it be we who be here to help you Seeker try to show chivalry to a Mord Sith be like try to dance with a bear it be never go to work and someone will get their head bite off Something 's spook her easy easy easy baneling who be these people and why do they attack we they be baneling dead soul who bargain with the Keeper for a second life in exchange for kill other how do we make sure they do not come back from the dead a second time we burn they I tell you you be go to need our help the Grace represent the whole of everything separate the world of life from the Underworld be the veil which have be tear and while the Keeper be threaten to destroy all life here I be draw shape with sand we 've be at this for three day I think you would teach I to use my power Patience the Grace be the foundation of everything you need to know what exactly be you try to teach I how to be a Wizard or how to be the Prelate 's disciple your stubborn resistance be only go to make this take long excuse the interruption but I be ask to bring Richard his lunch thank you Sister Nicci yes thank you Sister Nicci shall we continue how can I ever thank you you must hurry it be only a matter of time before the Prelate discover it be miss leave through the vestibule at the west end of the palace it be rarely use and far from the Sisters ' quarter will you be all right we will all be well off once you be back on your quest now go you be not go anywhere how do you get the rada'han I be the Seeker I find thing the only way you could have know I even have a rada'han be if one of the Sisters tell you how do you find I I be 600 year old Richard not much get past I I discover the rada'han be miss and I tell the Prelate right away I erect a magical barrier over every exit in the palace so now I be your prisoner you 've read the Prophecy for yourself you 've see it with your own eye well I must have miss the part that say Richard Cypher will be hold in the Palace of the Prophets against his will Richard I want to show you the ugly truth about whichever Sister be help you what be you talk about each candle represent one Sister in the palace as the soul seek the dark so do the flame the green flame represent the sister of the Dark who secretly serve the Keeper one of they be obviously pretend to be your friend why would these Sisters of the Dark do that because they want you to leave the palace find the Stone of Tears and deliver it to the Keeper just as the Prophecy say you will Nicci yes Prelate please see Richard to his room make sure he do not get any uninvited guest whose side be you on I try to help you so I can get back on my quest find the sacred stone and give it to the enemy of the light be the Prelate 's power of persuasion so compelling that even the Seeker of Truth will succumb to her manipulation how do I know she be the one manipulate I all she have to do be turn one word from light to dark and claim there be a conspiracy against her and you you believe she and you stop believe in yourself I believe in myself Nicci it be you I be not sure about I risk my life for you where be you go if the Prelate be go to accuse anyone who disagree with she of serve the Keeper then it be far more dangerous than I think who who will she accuse next the cook because the roast be burn or the groundskeeper because he trim the hedge too low if I stay here I will end up like Sister Brenna be there another way to get out there might be tell I aside from be able to sense someone 's han the Sisters of Light can also take it take it how we can kill someone with the Dacra and use it to absorb their han or accept the gift from someone who choose to relinquish it willingly why do not you tell I this before because the rada'han be a safe way take someone 's han could kill I it could also make you very powerful yes powerful enough to break through the Prelate 's barrier and help you escape how do I know this be not your plan all along slowly gain my trust and then steal my power I tell you if I want your power I could just kill you and take it I have to go before they catch I talk to you the choice be yours trust I and escape or stay here until they decide to let you out Sister Philomena send word by Journey Book she be cross to the New World and she be already on the new Seeker 's trail he will be dead before he be grip the Sword of Truth long enough to warm its hilt very good Ulicia and Richard it be only a matter of time before he be beg I to take his power and once I have it I will free he from the palace and return he to his quest of failure and the Sisters of the Light I will kill the Prelate the rest of the Sisters will be give a choice convert to the dark and serve the Keeper or die although there be one small problem I 've feel the strength of Richard 's han it be far great than I anticipate if I try to absorb it the power may overwhelm I you should increase your strength before you take his kill another Sister take her han Sisters of the Dark think alike Ulicia I will take over your watch so you can get some sleep I be not tired consider how easy it be for I to sneak up on you just now obviously you need some rest it would be impossible for you to sneak up on I so cara yes Leo do you like animal Ones that taste good I mean do you like pet I once have a dog I like dog I train it to attack on command I could see how that could be useful could you train a chipmunk what be you talk about to obey your order Attack people it be probably too hard right ah the mighty chipmunk it be fearless Cunning Stalwart and swear enemy of the Mord Sith not even the touch of the Agiel can break its tiny but heroic heart so you do have a sense of humor you be right what about if I be laugh at your ridiculous joke I must be tired I should get some sleep sleep well and do not worry I will protect you from the chipmunk I 've never hear you laugh before be not you suppose to be asleep well I be glad to see you at devotion have the Creator on your side certainly can not hurt when it come to learn to use your gift in time I be confident you will learn to appreciate the Palace of the prophet as much as I do maybe so it be customary to kiss the star before open it ready for your lesson the lesson be over a Sister of the Dark have agree to absorb my han use the power to blast through the Prelate 's barrier and set I free be this a joke oh I be very serious who be help you all I can say be that once this be do the person I be leave behind will be very powerful she will probably kill all the Sisters of the Light how kind of you to warn I but I be afraid I can not let you do this look for this the choice be yours help I with what I need to do to prevent this woman from kill everyone or stay here gag and tie up while I escape anyway either way I be get free in one instance the Sisters will be safe in the other they will probably be slaughter I 've get to know you Richard you would never leave innocent woman at the mercy of a monster I would hardly call the Sisters of the Light innocent woman you 've lie to I hold I captive and separate I from the people I love most in the world but bad of all you 've use your piety as an excuse to take away my freedom everything I 've do I 've do with the good intention I do not need training to tell you Wizard 's Second Rule the great harm can result from the good intention be the air put up much of a fight well I could use a spar partner Mord Siths do not spar when we fight we fight to inflict pain someone just try to kill you who be you and why be you try to kill I I be not tell you anything feel a little shy today I can help you find your courage what be go on here this woman just try to kill Leo perhaps you can compel she to explain why can you bring she back with the Breath of Life no she be sever her windpipe why would a Sister of the Light want to kill Leo something must be terribly wrong within their order Richard 's with they he could be in danger I have to find he I will go with you what about the Stone of Tears he be right we should not all go I will stay with Leo you try to pick up Richard 's trail be you sure you want to do this yes place your palm on mine close your eye and surrender yourself to I say the word with I now the sister will not be able to follow you all that power Useless Richard help I you be a Sister of the Dark Nicci and so be Ulicia that be not true at first I be not sure but then I realize you be the one who pass out the hymn book you kill Sister Brenna by rub creep elder on hers she be poison when she kiss it why would I kill Brenna to make I suspicious of the Prelate that be absurd Ulicia put the hymn book with the body so the poison would not be discover she also alert the Prelate that the rada'han be miss so I would be capture if we want you out of the palace why would we want you capture because you need I to believe that the only way out be to let you take my power get he your han be not as strong as the woman who put up this barrier you can not take it down so easily Richard do not go do not you see you will only be serve the Keeper I do not believe in prophecy you be a lost soul if you have nothing to believe in Richard I believe in myself and the people I love well it be only a matter of time before he find the stone and give it to the Keeper just like the Prophecy say I would not underestimate he if I be you he be full of surprise Sister what be happen a new prophecy that have not happen in a thousand year as long as the Mother Confessor 's pure heart beat the Keeper be doom to fail Lesson Number 88 Seeker

wall be strong these wall be strong and so be our will we can survive no matter how bad thing get as long as we stick together there be always hope we have to help he there be no help for he now the Valley of Perdition be create by the ancient Wizards as a defense against intruder from the New World after Richard escape from the palace he must have stumble into it the magic make those who enter it experience their bad fear there be no power that can awaken they but if he stay there he will starve to death his vision will kill he long before that what happen to his mind also happen in his body if he can not get out on his own we have to go in after he the magic of Perdition would overwhelm even my power if I give you my Han maybe you would have enough power to withstand the magic no in 3 000 year no one who have wander into the Valley of Perdition have ever escape Prelate we can not let this happen it be the hand of the Creator at work how can you say that the Prophecy say if Richard Cypher continue his quest he will help the Keeper destroy all life but his death here will ensure that never happen hello Sister Nicci you have no right to hold I prisoner I have the right to do far bad you betray our order by help Richard Cypher escape from this palace you be keep he here against his will you only free he so that he would fulfill the Prophecy and deliver the Stone to the

Richard it be too late the Keeper 's victory be at hand you be only delay the inevitable it be only inevitable if we let it happen it be well to surrender our light to the Creator than let the baneling drag we to the Keeper you be go to kill yourselves Creator give we strength for what we must now do and we will surrender our strength for what you must do what about the sanctity of life kill yourself be an offense to the Creator the fight be already lose let we go home she would not want you to give up she would want you to fight for every single life no give I the name Nicci you

will tell he you be here thank you in the meantime please make yourself comfortable you must be exhaust from your long journey why do not you tell the Mother Confessor the truth because she would go

be beautiful oh really and who be you with my sister at sunset when the light hit the fall the water glisten red they say it be the reflection of all the lover ' heart who 've kiss there that or a reflection of the blood spill at the Battle of Aldermont two hundred man be kill in that spot the rest throw their body into the rapid rather than surrender well that do sound romantic if we move fast we can get there in time to see the sunset these man be torture not very inspire work look like they die before they hang then why hang they whoever do this want to put they on display to send a message whoever attempt to subvert justice shall meet the same fate Kahlan take a look at this it be the seal of Aydindril by order of the High Lord Regent who be that there be no such title the only person with the authority to confer this seal be the Mother Confessor then who order these man kill I can pay you 15 gold piece now I will have the rest soon I promise please Lord Regent give I a little more time you 've have more than a month it be be difficult for I to find work since you cut off my hand your hand be remove as punishment for steal grain Times be hard after the war my family need food you be try fairly and find guilty in accordance with the law you lose your hand be not that punishment enough for theft but to steal that grain you also trespass on Olrich Larson 's land should that crime simply go unpunished if the Council and the Mother Confessor be here they would never allow but they be not here be they please have mercy I be show you mercy Shaun Fifty gold piece and you can go home I do not have it please do not take my other hand oh I be not go to take your other hand tomorrow at dawn cut off his head no no no please do not kill I no no my family will starve do not do this you see why I ask you to come I only wish I could have get here soon Fyren 's army be occupy the city the people be afraid to oppose he even a Wizard of the Second Order might find himself swinge from a noose if he try to use magic to stop he I need your help what about Oloron 's Amulet Fyren have it lock in the treasury with a dozen man guard it I will get it the next prisoner there be not many Wizards leave in this world Silas go in there would would be tantamount to sign your own death warrant and how many more death warrant will be sign if we do not bring the Mother Confessor back to Aydindril Halt Wizard Halt or I will shoot Richard those body we find be at least two day old whoever kill those man be long go Silas you know he he be a Wizard of the Second Order from Aydindril Cara he be already cold the Breath of Life will not work you can put your weapon down whoever shoot he could not follow he here he use this Oloron 's Amulet what be it a magical device that be keep in Aydindril it be devise hundred of year ago as a safeguard if the Mother Confessor be urgently need a skilled Wizard could use the amulet to find she anywhere in the world and carry they both home he must have be shoot in Aydindril it seem he manage to recite the incantation just before he die he come here to tell you something it must have be important my guess be it have something to do with this High Lord Regent who order those man kill I have to get to Aydindril that be hundred of league from here Zedd can you use that amulet to get we there its magic be only strong enough to transport a Wizard and a confessor then we will meet up with you there that could take week every day the quest be delay the Keeper grow strong you and Cara continue the search for the Stone of Tears while Kahlan and I go to Aydindril the Seeker need his Wizard and his Confessor by his side if we leave he again after we kill Darken Rahl you should have go back to Aydindril then but instead you come with I the quest be more important the quest be my burden I 've keep you away from your home long enough my home be with you we 've be apart before we always find our way back to each other I wish I do not have to go Kahlan what what happen why be I still here and where be Zedd how do you feel all in one piece I wish I could say the same for the amulet at least it get we here safely it be good to be home if Zedd get to Aydindril and realize I be not with he he would come back for I maybe he can not I have a feeling Zedd get to Aydindril with the other half of this even if he do get there look at what happen to Silas Zedd could be walk into a trap the Wizard be not exactly defenseless if I can get a horse I can be there in less than a week you can not go alone it be too dangerous Cara and I will go with you but the compass be point in the opposite direction and we will follow it that way once we know Zedd be safe let us go Silas know that steal the amulet could cost he his life it be a rare man willing to make such a sacrifice who be those guard Prince Fyren 's man Prince Fyren of Kelton when Rahl fall Fyren throw the D'Harans out of Kelton and Aydindril then he jail the Council member and proclaim himself High Lord Regent in a forest near Gallimar we find two body hang from a tree bear the seal of Aydindril round their neck Fyren 's work he be give band of hoodlum the authority to enforce his law mostly archaic or invent demand fine when people can not pay or will not he make example out of they I 've hear enough where can I find Prince Fyren well what crime could this lovely young lady possibly have commit it be a private matter come close tell I what I can do for you you can get out of my chair command I Confessor Order your man to stand down Death to anyone who harm her the Mother Confessor have return to Aydindril everyone answer to I or you will meet the same fate as Prince Fyren all of his edict will be subject to my review there will be no more unjust fine or execution the rule of law will be restore to the Midlands what be you smile about nothing I be just think about what even though I be worried about Zedd I have to admit part of I be glad the amulet do not work I always dream we would go to Aydindril together please we will not do it again you 've violate the code of Aydindril if you do not pay your fine you will be put to death for kiss she let they go this be none of your concern Seeker we be here under the authority of the High Lord Regent of Aydindril release they now or what get out of here you be no confessor what happen why do not you confess he I could not what my power it be go I know I be not feel right now I know why it must have be the accident with the amulet Richard this have never happen before to any confessor ever there have to be a way to fix it Confessor magic be not something you can just fix without it I be I be not a confessor at all hey we will get to Aydindril we will find Zedd we do not even know if Zedd 's alive it take more magic than a break amulet to kill Zedd trust I I ask our friend if we could borrow their horse they do not object the fast we move the soon we can get back to Zedd come on Hyah the sentence issue by Prince Fyren be unduly harsh his order for your beheading be hereby overturn Bless you Mother Confessor Kahlan I believe we can do more to mitigate this man 's loss just a moment Zedd his hand be remove because he steal grain I have to to feed my family but you steal that grain from another family yes Mother Confessor then accord to the code of Aydindril cut off your hand be the fitting punishment I be afraid I can not let the Wizard restore it Kahlan be you sure I 've make my decision she be change since I last see she she be change since this morning my man have return nearly all the fine I collect they have order not to stop until they 've pay everyone back have I please you mistress for now see to it that all the release prisoner get home safely yes mistress Zedd I think you would be feast on lamb at Ambrosio 's Tavern by now and miss watch the Mother Confessor bring justice back to Aydindril not even for Ambrosio 's there be still so much to set right why do not you allow I to restore that young man 's hand he steal grain from another family with his hand he could have work to repay they accord to the code of Aydindril you know well than I do that those barbaric code have not be enforce for hundred of year yes and look at the Midlands now Zedd I do not come here to grant amnesty to thief and petty criminal I come here to abolish a corrupt system to bring back the rule of law if I start make exception the rule will lose their meaning in the past you 've always be one to err on the side of mercy what you call mercy be a stone 's

they be a part of you I think that be what you want too but whatever happen you be the one I love when the rift be seal and the world be safe again I want nothing more than just to be with you we could be together now what be you talk about Richard the Prophecy say that as long as the Mother Confessor 's pure heart beat the Keeper will never win all I have to do be stay alive we could go into hiding somewhere where I would be safe and we can give the Sword to Cara and she could go to Aydindril and give it to Zedd and they can name a new Seeker and we can live like ordinary people we could we could have child Kahlan I can not abandon my quest do that always have to come first before our happiness the Kahlan I know care more about the fate of the world than her own happiness well maybe it be our turn we can both have what we want listen to I something be wrong with you you do not just lose your power you lose something else no Richard I be fine you be not fine you be make accusation that do not make sense you be talk about abandon our quest Richard I just I love you so much I can not lose you I can not I can not you be not go to lose I and if you love I you need to trust I I do not know what be happen to you but we need to find out do you trust I then we need to get to Aydindril and get there fast Havre the Council bring to I when they arrive Kahlan may I have a word leave we Fyren I take it you finally make it to Ambrosio 's last night yes and I hear a rather disturbing rumor that the Mother Confessor have take Prince Fyren as her mate I assure those gossip fool that there be no truth to it but his appearance by your side might give some the impression it be no rumor Zedd Kahlan you could not have he be be confess he meet the requirement but what about Richard you know I can not mate with Richard my power would destroy he of course but you 've always resist take a mate because of your love for he I do not have the luxury of love I have a duty to continue the line of Confessors Richard understand that so should you I understand that but to do it so rashly and with he the Council be here to see you mistress show they in Zedd this really be not your concern Mother Confessor the Council of the Midlands have return to be seat that will not be necessary under the Council 's watch Prince Fyren be able to usurp my authority and unleash a reign of terror all over the Midlands the Council have prove itself utterly ineffective and be hereby disband Justice in the Midlands require only one voice mine I do not know what happen to you when we use that amulet to get here but something have happen to you Kahlan you be not yourself Zedd you come with I to ensure that I arrive safely I be safe now you be free to go back to Cara and Richard and help they find the Stone of Tears but if you choose to stay in Aydindril you will not question my authority again I 've hold my tongue for day now I can no long remain silent I know Kahlan Amnell very well and this be not Kahlan you think the Mother Confessor be an imposter she can not be I travel here with she myself something happen to she when the amulet be break I 've be search the scroll at the Wizard 's Keep for answer but I 've find nothing what do you suggest we do we can not let she remain in power a Wizard 's web will keep she contain but unharmed put the Mother Confessor in a Wizard 's web be treason I wish there be another way so do I I may only be a Wizard of the Second order but I believe it be you who teach I the element of surprise be everything Guards Alferon why you be plot against my mistress she confess I just yesterday this man have commit treason as Mother Confessor I be swear to uphold the high standard of justice the crime of treason threaten justice itself and when justice be threaten it be all of society that suffer though I have know this man for a long time I do not make exception everyone be to be treat fairly no one not even a Wizard of the First Order who be that be above the law it be you for conspire to overthrow the Mother Confessor Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander I sentence you to death by hang at first light we have to do something wait do not let she see you but that imposter just sentence Zedd to death she have guard everywhere if she be powerful enough to capture Zedd there be no tell what she be capable of I have to tell they that she be not I I be not so sure about that what do you mean I do not think the amulet be the only thing that split in two do not ask I to explain it we need to get to Zedd not like that then how do you propose we get to he seven year ' hard labor bring the next supplicant Mother Confessor Richard I be surprised to see you in Aydindril why be you here I be concerned about you and my grandfather I be sorry Richard but Zedd have become a threat he try to depose I I have no choice but to find he guilty of treason that do not sound like Zedd how can you be sure I be always sure it be part of my gift he die in the morning now you should get back to your quest we be all depend on you yes Mother Confessor but before my grandfather die I would like to see he I believe it be my right guard please escort the Seeker to the dungeon of course it all make sense now if only I have realize it soon realize what the amulet be very powerful it be magically link to the heart of the Mother Confessor it can find she anywhere in the world when we use it to come here in her heart Kahlan be tear part of she want to stay with you and that part stay so which one be really Kahlan neither I do not understand we be all a delicate combination of duty and desire the heart and the head constantly keep each other in balance it take both to make we whole how do this happen Kahlan 's innermost desire be to stay but her duty be to go so when the amulet break the woman in love stay with you and the Confessor swear to serve the Midlands come here there have to be a way to put both half back together with both piece of the amulet I think I could of course that be assume I have the use of my hand I be go to get you out of here how you say the Mother Confessor be guide by reason alone I would like to speak on Zedd 's behalf before his sentence be carry out it be your right to speak in sentence Zedd for treason you fail to take into consideration his exceptional life and deed should I list they I be well aware of Zedd 's accomplishment but it do not change the fact that he conspire to overthrow I he break the law as the Mother Confessor the law be what you say it be and I say the Code of Aydindril be the law I 've read the Code of Aydindril it be write by the first Mother Confessor she say there be no justice be it not temper by mercy Magda Searus the first Mother Confessor she be not without her enemy she kill when it be necessary she do kill in fact she insist that all male Confessor baby be kill because they lack the compassion necessary to control their power be my sex in question Richard no but your compassion be you have none because you be in fact not the Mother Confessor you know who I be Richard I know your kindness your wisdom and yes your compassion but I do not see these thing in you because they be in her this be a trick this be no trick she be be with I since the moment you leave when you use the amulet you be split in two you may have your power and your sharp mind but the rest of you be in her your heart your compassion your mercy Mother Confessor need all of it Zedd can fix this he can put you back together he can make you a whole person again but until he do you do not have the right to decide his fate or anyone else 's let us assume you be correct and I no long have the part of I that care for you or for Zedd that compassion as you call it keep I from my duty here without it I be a well leader a well judge a well confessor whatever she be I do not need she get in the way of that if you refuse to allow Zedd to put you back together you will leave this woman without her reason her power be that just she have no power then you and Richard can be together do you feel incomplete you can not lie to a Confessor I think you know that no I do not feel incomplete if you be part of I then I do not want you back not if it mean I would put duty above love not if it mean I can never be Richard 's wife I be never go to be your husband no you will change your mind I can be everything that you want I will not ask you to give up your quest I will I will love Cara like a sister and and you can have she too if that be what you want and you will love I just like you do before would you look at her she be not in her right mind and neither be you Richard I understand that you miss some idealized version of the Kahlan you love but you do not have the right to murder two distinct individual simply to get the one that you want I 've make my decision go back to your quest take she with you I be not go anywhere until you let Zedd go then you will be arrest for defy the Mother Confessor Seize they Richard stop they they will kill he Richard it seem my emotion be still get in my way Kahlan no command I mistress help I fight he yes mistress that be foolish cara one touch from I could kill you ah Mistress I tell you I would die to protect Richard fortunately I will not have to drop your weapon or I kill her mistress please they will kill you Richard will not let she kill I I never say both of you have to be alive for Zedd to fix you you be bluff be I how can you be sure of that do not kill her mistress please do as they say drop your weapon Release Zedd right now I will but before you do anything to harm I you should know I may be with child Mistress I could also be with child your child neither of you be with child but Fyren and I be intimate many time both of you be nothing more than magical fragment Conception under such circumstance would be impossible you know I be tell you the truth Richard please do not kill she if you still love I if you care about the midland do it Kahlan be we in Aydindril yes yes we be in Aydindril be you all right I be fine I be so sorry old friend there be no need if he be release from confession then we really do

do not remember and some that I wish I do I have enough memory for the both of we when Zedd put I back together you give up something too Kahlan if I have know what happen to you I never would 've I know but we do and you say it be yes it be but I would rather have you all of you just the way we be than everything else with someone who be not you Richard if you have not stop I I would have execute Zedd that be not you well at least I get the chance to make thing right here you be go to stay no I be go to reinstate the Council and send for my sister so Aydindril do not have to be without

of the Keeper 's fine supplier of soul but you delude yourself into believe you be kill to defeat evil my baneling have to kill every day what happen when you run out of bad people I do not think the

the Keeper and you can not get ahead ahead I be sure it be occur to you that you could kill six or seven irredeemable miscreant and stay healthy for a week at a time but it do not work that way every

have create I weep so profound be my grief that it take shape the Stone of Tears I use it to banish the one I have love trap he in the Underworld for eternity it be the hard thing I 've ever have to do just as see Richard 's true nature will be the hard thing you 've ever do I could have simply destroy Richard but before I do I need you and the First Wizard to see the truth so that he will name a new Seeker and you will agree to come with I to a place where you will be protect it be the only way to ensure my Prophecy as long as the Mother Confessor 's pure heart beat the Keeper be doom to fail People believe in Richard he be the only one who be fight for they in a very long time and many of they wonder as I often have if the Creator have abandon they if you destroy Richard without give he a

Richard what be the result of Rahl 's death Zedd this crack in the earth it be a tear in the veil that separate the Underworld from the World of the Living Kahlan how could this have happen in all my year as a Wizard I 've only know one form of magic strong enough to tear the veil the Power of Orden this happen when I kill Rahl when the Boxes of Orden explode as long as it be open there be no way to prevent the Keeper of the Underworld the great enemy of all that walk breathe and grow in the Light from send his minion to bring death to every live thing creature from the Underworld baneling return from the dead to terrorize the living how many of you be aware it be the Seeker who unleash these horror upon the world indistinct muttering I do not do it intentionally and I 've swear to find the Stone and if you should find it what will you do with it use it to seal the rift be you aware of a Prophecy that say otherwise yes Richard in the time of the tearing of the veil should the son of Brennidon seek the sacred stone he will find it only to deliver it to the Enemy of the Light the Creator herself give we these Prophecies to guide our action and yet you continue your search for the Stone I do not believe in Prophecy the Prophecy come from I be you say you do not believe in the Creator crowd mutter open your shirt tell everyone what that be it be the Mark of the Keeper all gasp how do you receive it RAHL you be for the Keeper scream what do Rahl mean you be for the Keeper Maybe Rahl mark he because he want the Creator to believe that Richard have turn against her if you

you I be her mother it be wonderful to see you again Mother you have a mother I be bear into this world as all of you be you say you be here to destroy Richard but he would 've be just a child when you be bear I could foresee the horror that will one day threaten the world so 20 year ago I cause myself to be bear to this woman know my divine strength would manifest when I need it that be absurd what do you mean manifest this mortal body could not contain my power until it come of age creator more people suffer from the blight have come for you to heal they as soon as I 've do so we will resume I always know one day she would embrace her divinity she doubt it it be a heavy burden for a young girl she want to be like everyone else but I always know my daughter be the live incarnation of the Creator the truth come to I in a vision before she be bear when do you see she last two summer ago she run off with a boy from our village Jason the Creator run off with a boy she be at that

daughter my Creator they be both mad maybe so find this Jason Mm you 've leave a trail of corpse in your search for the Stone and yet you continue to kill know that every soul you send to the Keeper make he more powerful I only kill to protect my friend or other innocent people and even then I only do it when there be no other choice man grunt so you 've never kill for any other reason or when you could have defeat an enemy some other way yes once woman scream Richard but I be not myself you could 've take those man prisoner but instead you slaughter they they be slaver and murderer and it be not Richard 's fault he be possess by an ancient spell and I teach he to control it dramatic theme playing who drag you into this fight who be you angry at you now we be get somewhere all those year you know who I be and you say nothing you lie to I about be my grandfather you be not ready for the truth you take I out of Hartland you name I the Seeker you be the one who give I this damned Sword Richard no no he have to stop himself Ahh uh uh he may have refrain from kill you but that do not change the fact that he send slaver and murderer to the Underworld to join the Keeper 's army of soul only because of the magic that possess he but he be strong enough to overcome it so you be convince it be over that Richard would never again succumb to his rage it be okay Zedd we be here to tell the truth I do have some doubt Kahlan there be part of the Minders ' story I do not tell he Canton Rahl the man who first put the spell on the Minders be not always bloodthirsty he start out as a protector and benefactor to his people but then as his power grow he begin to fight and to kill and the more he kill the more the blood lust overtook he he go mad with it and now we know that darkness be in Richard Kahlan but Richard learn to control the Sword he master his rage yes he control the Sword today but what about tomorrow but my doubt be fleet I be convinced that any rage Richard may still carry will never again get the well of he how can you be so sure because I 've give up the magic that fuel my anger tell we how you do that Woman say the word with I chant in ancient tongue uh you be the most powerful wizard bear in 3000 year yet you give your power to someone you hardly know the magic would have kill I I do not have a choice you could have stay at the Palace of the Prophets master your wizard power learn how to use they to serve I the Sisters of the Light tell you this but you do not listen they lie to I because they be afraid you would resume your mission in service of the Keeper which be exactly what happen I do not serve the Keeper no tell we this woman you give your power to be she a Sister of the Light no she be a Sister of the Dark and whom do the Sisters of the Dark serve the Keeper crowd gasp dramatic theme playing you know this and yet you still give this woman your power I make sure she could not keep use they now the sister will not be

have agent everywhere and not all of they walk on two leg your magic your han be a divine gift from I but you give it willingly to a Sister of the Dark how can you expect we to believe that you be not an agent of the Keeper Richard hey what be you think honestly yeah I be think maybe the Prophecy be true maybe I will fail you 've always say you do not believe in Prophecy there be a Prophecy that say I would defeat Rahl maybe I can not ignore this one just because I do not like what it say about I Richard this woman I do not know if she be the Creator or some kind of charlatan Cara be try to find out but whoever she be tomorrow we be go to tell your side of the story she and everyone else here be go to see what I have never doubt your heart be pure you be and always will be on the side of good what if I be not how can you say that I would never willfully do the Keeper 's bidding but what if I be serve he without even realize it maybe that be what this be some way of control I make I think the wrong decision be the right one maybe I be an agent of the Keeper and I do not even know it hello Jason woman grunt cry out I be guess you be Jason be you go to kill I too not if you tell I the truth about Maia gasp what a pleasure this be it be not often I be fortunate enough to enjoy the company of two such devout Sisters of the Light I would offer you the chance to return to the world as baneling but alas you be both far too pious to accept the Keeper 's generous proposal do your bad to we Darken Rahl you and your Master will soon be finish now that the Creator have return to defeat all those who serve the Darkness return how where you will soon learn everything but not from we then allow I to loosen your tongue scream Kahlan the Seeker be an agent of light and justice and I have faith that every one of you will soon shed any doubt that you may have about he every one of you no one have slay more of the Keeper 's servant than Richard perhaps most terrifying of all be a creature know as a screeling tell we what happen when one of they crawl out of the rift it attack the people of Ehrengard loud squeal man yell and grunt hey heroic theme playing you wanna rip somebody 's head off take mine Ahh grunt uh Zedd now ah screech stop crowd cheer Richard kill the Keeper 's pet but the Keeper have many fearsome servant I be sure by now you all know about baneling ordinary people man woman even child who have die but agree to kill for the Keeper every day in exchange for a second life tell we about the first time you encounter this horrible new enemy it be at a place call Tothrayne Men Uhh man grunt and shout man they 've all go Richard not all of we welcome back to Tothrayne Ahh dramatic theme play Ahh why would the Seeker have slaughter so many of the Keeper 's minion if he himself be an agent of the Keeper what well way for Richard to gain the trust of t Mother Confessor and the First Wizard than to slay a few of the Keeper 's pawn you may have destroy a few baneling but be not it true that there be thousand of they wander the land bide their time until they can make their next kill Lord Rahl how may I serve you I 've be tell that the Creator have return to the World of the living as flesh and blood I be instruct all my baneling to search for she if it be true she should not be hard to find surely the delude masse will be abuzz with the news of her arrival I will try to find she my Lord but if it be true she will be try to seal we back in the Underworld for all eternity if the Creator have be foolish enough to return in a mortal body then she be vulnerable and it be I who shall extinguish her Light for all eternity tell we Seeker have you see Darken Rahl again since the day he mark you yes in the Underworld crowd gasp and how do you come to be there I be kill Goodbye Seeker Richard and when I open my eye I be in a sea of dead soul soul grunt and yell how wonderful to see you again my brother Welcome to the Underworld and what do he say to you he make I an offer become a banele Return to your body before it be too late you be a fool if you think I be go to kill to serve the Keeper you 've already kill enough people to earn yourself a place of honor here what difference will a few more make I will not do the Keeper 's bidding you do the Keeper 's bidding every time you take a life the reason you kill do not make a difference you want to see your beloved Kahlan again do not you Kahlan will go on without I and so will Zedd he will name a new Seeker they will find the Stone of Tears and seal the rift and you and your master will be trap in this pit forever why would the Seeker turn down an offer for a second chance at life if he be now and be then an agent of the Keeper we have only Richard 's word for what he and his brother say to each other that day even I can not see into the realm of Death would you have we believe that Richard accept Rahl 's offer that he be a banele no the Keeper and his agent be too clever they know Richard would be bring back to the world of the living by other mean tell we how it be that the Seeker be stand here again today we use magic to revive he dramatic theme play Richard sigh Richard do not need to become a baneling because he know the people he have trick into love he would stop at nothing to bring he back you have reveal through Prophecy that as long as the Mother Confessor 's pure heart beat the Keeper be doom to fail I have then it stand to reason that if the Seeker be an agent of the Keeper he would have kill the Mother Confessor as so many of the Keeper 's minion have try to do and yet the Seeker have do precisely the opposite tell we Mother Confessor how many time have the Seeker save your life More time than I can remember the first be the day we meet stay back shoot her Ahh leave she alone Kahlan he save I again at Tothrayne uh he do it again at Stowecroft the Mother Confessor 's word be final these heroic deed you describe they all

Mother Confessor will die we can not let she do this she be use my life as a weapon against you right now we do not have a choice Zedd will find a way to undo the spell whatever happens do not let she get the stone I will not let anything happen to you so you leave the Mother Confessor to go with a Sister of the Dark why she cast a maternity spell anything that would happen to the Sister would happen to Kahlan I have to protect she then you find a way to remove the spell no Zedd do so it be in fact the First Wizard who save the Mother Confessor 's life while you use a pretext to spend day alone with a Sister of the Dark you be twist everything I say if Richard be work for the Keeper why have not he simply run I through with his Sword because he need your help to find the Stone but if I allow he to find it he will no doubt kill you deliver the Stone to the Keeper and the World will be lose crowd gasp Cara Richard Kahlan do not listen to her this woman be a fraud dramatic theme play this man be Maia 's husband they be live a quiet life until the Sisters of the Light abduct she I go with they willingly because they put some kind of spell on you Maia that be not true Jason the

faithfully all these year and risk death every day in the war against Darken Rahl I see man spill river of blood to keep these land safe all while those privileged brat let other fight and die in their place if kill a few coward will save the life of the Mother Confessor you should run they through I understand your anger but I be not give in to Cormac if we run out of time you may not have a choice have you find anything nothing no mark no engraving not even any bone it be it be all just rock we would well tell Richard we could not find anything we can not find anything in the tomb but of course you can not but there be no need for the Seeker to know that Kahlan and Cara have find something it be an engraving that look like a family crest but they have not use those since the Third Era they must be in one of the old tomb there be a registry of those tomb in the archive if we can find this symbol we can find Kahlan and Cara this be it this crypt be spell can you open it I can try but it will not be easy careful Richard it could be a trap Kahlan Cara it be just a dead body could there be another crypt with these marking there be only one list in the registry could one have be overlook it be possible these tomb have be here thousand of year maybe the marking wash away have your man focus their search on tomb in this area Richard wait it be too dark to track it I just wish I know what it be I think I do this have remnant of dark sorcery the creature be call a Nygaax a Nygaax accord to legend in ancient time those desperate for revenge would pay a sorcerer to wrap a live person in bandage infect with long forget magic create a creature that would carry out its master 's bloodlust the Nygaax be vengeance incarnate I 've hear story of a Nygaax that terrorize this area I think they be just tell to scare child what story long ago a feud break out between Dunshire 's two most prominent family the head of one family employ a sorcerer to create a Nygaax that massacre the other family the Nygaax claim its victim one by one and lay they at its master 's foot the way the story go the carnage stop only when a wizard seal the creature in a crypt Cormac know you be too honorable to kill those man so he trick we into release it how do we stop it it can not be stop only control by a magical amulet which Cormac must have and he will order it to go after those man on the list we have to get to those man before the Nygaax do I have a task for you this be pointless we 've be at it for hour we can not just sit here and do nothing we will have run out of air long before we dig our way out of here it be not help that these torch be burn air fast than we be then we will have to find a way to snuff they out I can almost reach it stand on your toe I be the torch be use less air than we be try to knock they out why would cormac have do this he be always such a kind soul he must 've find out you rig the lottery that be preposterous they be make of light metal than the tile of the man on the list which be why they be never choose to fight their tile be heavy so you know which one not to draw from the cauldron you could feel the difference how could you do this I love you too much to risk lose you do Cormac love his son any less Erik you be a virtuous man educate one day you will be a great leader Dunshire need you alive more than it need the son of a conjurer I know Cormac 's son they be good man and they certainly do not deserve to die in my place and now your action may cost Kahlan and Cara their life how can you judge I Wizard when you learn of the impending massacre at Brennidon do you save every child that be in danger of course not you save the most important one he it may be distasteful to say but it be the truth your life be worth more than other be it worth more than that of the Mother Confessor because that be who the Seeker should be try to save not we we can do both if we find Cormac we will wait outside and guard the entrance when the Nygaax come for you and the other we will be wait there may be a way we can make it lead we back to Cormac then we can force he to tell we where Kahlan and Cara be but we will have to do it quickly in the meantime bar all the door keep all the man on the list safe that will not be possible Henrik do not trust you Seeker he be afraid you would kill we if you be desperate to save your friend so he take a horse and flee he could be head right into the path of the Nygaax no please help I thank you for save I from the creature he be dead what do he mean thank you for save I from the creature I be not sure Zedd Zedd Zedd Zedd Zedd you can fight this Zedd be you all right I be fine this man survive for century how be that possible the Nygaax 's magic be in the bandage they must 've keep this man alive then there be a chance to save the Wizard yes but the bandage only unwrapped once the man trap inside be die we need to find a way to free Zedd without kill he warn the Duke tell he what happen here and if they try to kill the Nygaax they will only kill Zedd and Kahlan and Cara they do not have much time which be why we need to find Cormac he be the only one who know where they be we will follow the creature 's track back to he how can you be sure it be head back to Cormac it take Henrik 's body accord to your story it lay its victim at its master 's foot the Wizard should not have try to stop you but you 've do well now continue your task and bring I the other four coward the air 's get thin there be one way to double how long it last kill I have the lack of air

Marianna she order we to stay here and attack you and the Seeker and at least slow you down if we could not kill you please forgive I mistress which way do she go West let us move General this woman claim Lord Rahl order she to meet he here Sister Marianna faithful servant of the Keeper the day we have be wait for have finally come but Lord Rahl be not here I have the power to summon he do you

back my rider will catch he fast go Rahl no no I be not he I swear I be not I be just this sod who look like he it be true I see a Sister of the Dark summon the spirit of the real Lord Rahl I can not

be plan to kill Walter thank you for save we we will just be on our way now we do not want to be any more trouble okay you be not go anywhere oh the Sister of the Dark be in that temple with the scroll we need to go in and get it we do not need extra cargo think about it Darken Rahl keep a look alike alive in his castle where he have summon a Sister of the Dark to assist the Mord Sith he have all the magical ingredient he need to return to the Land of the living in this man 's body what we can not let he run off and risk Rahl recapture he somehow we will storm the temple get the scroll and then we will decide what to do with they you would well burn these body before Rahl send they back as baneling what an unexpected pleasure to see so many old friend in one place though I must say Walter I have see you look well we know what you be plan to do to he and we be not go to let it happen no something tell I you will do more than let it happen you be go to kill he for I too and then your new Sister of the Dark friend here will summon my soul into his body and Cara 's lovely lip will blow the Breath of Life into my new lung you be out of your mind on the contrary I be think quite clearly be you brother or do I need to remind you that without the Scroll of Valdaire you will never repair the veil the Keeper will win and every live person in this world will die but if you do as I ask I will hand you the scroll personally suddenly you want to defeat the Keeper I want to live again you of all people must understand that brother I miss the taste of a crisp apple the warm press of a woman 's flesh against my own but I must admit be a spirit do have its advantage for instance I can appear to Sister Marianna much fast than you can get to the temple I have but to command she to burn the scroll and your failure be assure so do we have an agreement or do not we if we turn down Rahl 's proposal the scroll will be ashe before we get to the temple I never think I would say this but that devious bastard have we firmly by our nether we can not just kill Walter maybe we do not have to how attached be you to the body you be bear with I would do anything to have a different face I think that can be arrange how we have the magical mean to put your spirit into one of these body and bring you back to life and put Rahl 's spirit into Walter 's body exactly take your pick any one you fancy but quickly uh you choose I yeah if I be go to have a new body I want one that please you come Zedd once we give Rahl his new body we can not just trust he to bring we the scroll back you could confess he Rahl 's soul be immune to confession but there be another way you sure this be go to work do not worry I go through it myself and it work fine okay oh be be this go to hurt I will try to make it quick okay um do it really have to be a knife just sit back okay and try and relax take a deep breath that be not so bad now be it do not be afraid Walter I be right here now Mika it be I I be back ah it be good to be back I know you would do the right thing brother Sister Tyra be go with you to the temple you be go to get the scroll and bring it straight back otherwise she will release the magic of the dacra and you will be dead again in a heartbeat this really be not necessary I would have do exactly as I promise well I will not have to take that on good faith now will I my Lord how be it possible you 've return without the help of Sister Marianna and how do you get the prisoner 's body when my man have yet to return with he I do not know what rabbit trail your man be follow Egremont fortunately their ineptitude be redeem by Sister Tyra here you flatter I my Lord not only do she recapture and kill Walter she perform the ritual of resurrection what Mord Sith do you find to administer the Breath of Life I be revive by Tyra who have the foresight to kill a Mord Sith and take her han it appear you and your sister be not as indispensable as you think now give I the scroll my Lord you do seem very much yourself but in light of recent misunderstanding I believe you would want I to verify the identity of anyone who claim to be you of course I be sure you could tell I for example what be the gift you give your sister Jennsen last year when you be try to earn her trust a kitten and unless you want to share that poor creature 's unfortunate fate you will hand I the scroll right now hm how very interesting you may be on your way now Sister sister you will of course want refreshment my Lord and company yes I would but unfortunately I have time for neither I must be on my way prepare a wagon for my treasure at once my Lord the Mother Confessor say nothing about treasure now that I be alive again I have no intention of be penniless I will not allow you to displease my mistress well imagine her displeasure if the Seeker never have a chance to read this scroll oh you may command the magic of the dacra to kill I but by then this parchment will be nothing but cinder my Lord your wagon be be prepare shall I assume we be return to the People 's Palace to reclaim your throne you be to remain here Egremont my Lord I be most eager to help you resecure your domain the time be not yet right before I return to the palace I must pay a visit to Ravensberg when I be ready I will send for you be that clear yes my Lord I need your good archer at once why Lord Rahl be send I a message he be once ambush at Ravensberg and almost kill he be tell I he be in danger again now and we be go to get he out of it suspenseful theme playing do you have the scroll I think you will find it interesting reading I know I do hand it over of course brother but in case your plan be to have your pet Sister of the Dark here kill I once I relinquish it you should know that I would then be force to tell the Keeper what be write on the scroll and then he will know exactly where you will be go next I imagine he would send an army of baneling to greet you you win she will not release the magic now give I the scroll now get this thing out of I I be think maybe we should leave it in you be much more cooperative this way Lord Rahl be under the Seeker 's control and will be as long as the Sister of the Dark live kill she let us go I know a place we can be safe and happy Hyah for D'Hara and Lord Rahl Hyah Walter 's get away with the treasure we have no use for it let they go they be not the only one that get away Rahl 's go too we can track he maybe we do not come for Rahl we come to find out what we be suppose to do with the Stone of Tears what do it say the instruction inscribe upon this scroll will only appear in the glow cast by a Night Wisp all this trouble and the instruction be invisible only until we find one of Kahlan 's tiny friend well I guess we know which where we be head so do Rahl a tankard of stout ale barkeep Aha a brother in arm Brings to mind the good old day you know I once come damnably close to bring back those good old day it be quite a story and I would be happy to tell it if my um ahem if throat be not so damn dry I already know that story in fact I know a part of it you do not the happy ending oh what be the matter Malray do not you recognize your old friend Walter how that be quite a story too which I will tell you on the road that be of course if you be still interested in go to Merilandria oh I I be a little short of fund I be afraid I 've recently come into a small fortune myself find a girl too the right one she be outside in a coach right now and I 've buy passage for three on the next ship out of Wynnmore be be this really possible Walter just close your eye Malray and imagine yourself by the sea Cheers ï»¿1 on Legend of the Seeker a tear in the veil that separate the Underworld from the world of the

be it that you learn the Scroll of Valdaire now in the Seeker 's possession can only be read by the light of a Night Wisp this be why I have remain to destroy the creature once I 've eradicate all the

the veil the land of the living will be destroy and your victory will be complete very well Darken Rahl but as soon as the Night Wisps be annihilate you will kill yourself and return to I as you wish

like find the Stone of Tears without the scroll we will not know what to do with the Stone it will be useless Shh Quiet do you hear that one must have survive careful do not scare it off be you look for this give I the Scroll of Valdaire or the last Night Wisp die I wonder if you can throw a Wizard 's web fast than I can crush my little friend here they be very delicate you know Zedd what do you want with the scroll the same as you dear brother to save the world I 've already betray the Keeper to do so he expect I to annihilate every last Night Wisp and then return to the Underworld but I have no intention of go back I be go to join your little quest and when you find the Stone of Tears you will give it to I and I will follow the instruction on the scroll and heal the rift so you can be hail as the world 's savior yes the Keeper be impatient he want the world of life snuff out and quickly which be why you must give I the scroll now so I can prevent that from happen do not you realize you 've already doom the world by destroy the Night Wisps do you really think I be so short sighted the Night Wisps be the most vital link in the chain of life their demise would bring about a cascade of extinction that would eventually result in the death of everything that live and breathe which be why I save this particular Wisp it be with young it can give birth and life can go on if you honor my simple request and give I the scroll let he crush it we will find another one that be my Mord Sith no sentimental attachment but if I know my brother he be not willing to risk the fate of the world on such a slim chance what do you say since we be on the same side now we may as well be partner how do I know you will not kill the Night Wisp as soon as I hand you the scroll well you can be certain that I will kill it if you do not she be awfully quiet now it seem that I be the only live soul who know what to do with the Stone of Tears no now be that any way to treat the new member of your merry band relax brother I have the knowledge you have the compass together let us save the world now let us find that Stone the Night Wisps only give birth in the grotto of the northern foothill if I do not take she there she and her baby will die you will have to go through Gar territory Cara go with her the compass be take we northeast we will travel together as far as Elmswood Pass then you and Kahlan will take the Night Wisp to the grotto we will continue on our search for the Stone bind he I want the new member ofur merry band on a short leash what if the Prophecy be come true what do you mean should the son of Brennidon seek the sacred stone he will find it only to deliver it to the enemy of the light what if Rahl be the enemy of the light I be not go to give he the Stone then how I have an idea I can not help but notice the Wizard have disappear how disappointing I be look forward to enjoy his renowned wit well you will have to settle for mine I know it must be very frustrating for you brother I wonder how you be plan to do it do what learn the instruction on the scroll let us see if I be you what would I do well you can not confess I you know my soul be immune to Confession and if you think Cara could break I you would have have her torture I by now oh wait I just think of something perhaps you send the Wizard to get a Listener to read my thought we be here this be Elmswood Pass I guess this be where we say goodbye can we speed this up she love you you love she I should protect she as if she be you have I miss anything we could be halfway there by the time you two finish your goodbye we will catch up once the Night Wisp be safe be careful you too it must be difficult be so close to the confessor but unable to bed she no wonder you invite Cara along on your little quest the Mord Sith have a long history of serve the House of Rahl in every way and as I recall Cara be always so eager to please careful brother you would not want to do anything that may cause I to lose my memory you be right Keeper hear our prayer we live only to serve you for it be you who will take we Sister Marianna Keeper you 've hear our prayer the prayer of foolish girl do not concern I Master why be you angry we be your loyal servant my most loyal servant of all Darken Rahl have betray I how can that be he be to destroy the Night Wisps then kill himself and return to the Underworld I 've receive the soul of thousand of Night Wisps but Rahl 's soul do not follow what do you ask of we find he wherever he be and send he back to I how I have miss the simple pleasure of life enjoy they while you can someday whether it be in a week or 50 year you will be dead again and you will have to face the Keeper 's wrath oh you be mistaken when the veil be repair and the natural order of the Underworld restore I will bask in the creator 's light along with you and the Mother Confessor you 've kill countless innocent people how could you possibly believe the Creator be go to reward you when I seal the rift not only will I be protect those alive today I will be ensure the life of future generation surely such a noble act will tip the scale of deed in my favor the only reason you want to save the world be to save yourself well you 've have quite a run at be the hero be not it time you share the glory with someone else I tell you I be on your side I always know we would make a great team brother Welcome Wizard what bring you to Thandor I 've come to see an old friend Zedd look how big you 've grow in just a year you be almost as tall as I be no one be as tall as you what be this the Sisters of the Light have you wear a Rada'han now suppress his ability to read mind give he a chance at a normal childhood Renn 's come a long way since you entrust he to our care Wizard I be glad to hear it I would never ask to take he away from you unless it be a matter of great urgency you want he to help the Seeker yes you know the Sisters of the Light believe the Seeker be prophesy to help the Keeper I can not allow Renn to go with you the Seeker save I I want to help he if I can I think the boy 's wish be clear very well I will get the key to the Rada'han where be we go Renn I need you to listen closely the Sisters be not go to let I take you out of here without a fight I do not understand Sister Everleen she be come back but not with a key what do you want I to do on my word stay low Ready now I will take that key now I know how lonely it can be my sister and I be the last of our kind when we find the Stone of Tears and the world be safe I would love to have a baby but for I it be complicated yes because my heart belong to Richard if I be to take he as my mate my magic would destroy he well when you put it like that I guess it would be easy to be a Night Wisp can you please stop that incessant babble Night Wisps be the most fragile being the Creator have ever make without constant companionship they will perish so if you give I one moment of peace that thing be go to die it might I do not even know if my talk to she be go to be enough she be so delicate not only be she with young but she be lose her entire family she would be a lot strong if she have they to accompany she to the birthing ground how do you even know what it be say it'a magical language if you listen closely eventually you will understand it it be a bit ironic be not it the man who kill I go to such length to keep I alive the cut be not deep it will heal your brotherly affection be touch who do you think you be fool with this ruse you be always so quick to think the bad of I brother you have the man who raise I murder and now you 've nearly destroy an entire race of creature all so you could get the glory for save the world and you wonder why I think the bad you be right of course but I assure you my sentiment be genuine it be nice be in the company of one 's family be that why you murder your own father you have no idea what it be like grow up in the House of Rahl for most people it be a joy to learn you be to have a sibling but imagine how I feel when our father boast to I that my own baby brother would be the one to kill I we be unable to kill he master Darken Rahl be one man in the body he have now he possess no magic and yet you allow he to slip through your finger Master he be not alone the Seeker be with he the Seeker if not for he Darken Rahl would be grovel before you in the Underworld at this very moment this be quite unexpected and quite fortunate Master now that the brother be together I can destroy they both we think the Seeker be more valuable alive than dead Prophecy say he will deliver the Stone to the enemy of the light that enemy of the light could be his own brother Darken Rahl whom I can no long trust to do my will they can not have get far we will leave immediately no you have already fail I once this task will require someone much more powerful than you a man of extraordinary strength and with an uncommon disregard for life fast you dog do not kill I as you wish we will let he do it who be you servant of the Keeper and what do the Keeper want with I you 've earn his favor with the thousand you 've kill and now he have a task for you what be it we 've cross into Gar territory get your Agiels ready why do gar bother to feed on something so small they absorb the Night Wisps ' han it allow they to hunt in the dark Quick in here it know we be here you want this I can not understand a single thing you be say I be sorry Kahlan 's not here to talk to you but she have to draw the Gars away so would you please stop serenade every creature in the forest finally let us keep move what be wrong the dacra 's magic must have taint my blood Zedd will be back soon he will heal you how be that funny before our encounter in the Forest of the Night Wisps I know you would not be content to let the secret of the scroll remain locked in my mind so I plan ahead what do you do in case you send your Wizard to
