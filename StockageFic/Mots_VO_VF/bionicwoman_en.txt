you trust I bring I proof that Jonas be tell the truth that they make advancement they can use to fix I I might remember where he can find Anthros take this rope we will tie he and take he take the rope tie his hand up we get to move what be you go to do to he no bad than what he be go do to you you want answer right then when you be do take he down to the fan room what about you and Stevens what about I he stay what be you talk about you decipher the flash drive I be stall you read it what be on the flash drive tell I you blueprint material everything there be to know about bionic if you know what be on that drive then you know who give it to I to decipher not to read this do not make any sense we come here to save he and we would have I be not go to say anything yeah until you be catch torture or your brother be take they put a machete to a pretty girl 's neck you be go to give it up I be try to save you take he down to the fan room so you be just go to kill he be that it jaime go go Damn it far end of the building fan room I will meet you there go you let he go he talk you be in the crosshair a target for people to catch and dissect you will not last a month then I will not be you okay you 've be hit go through thank you what you do back there it be stupid I be go to get we both kill I have no plan you know that right there will be supply in here for your wound we can not stop no you can not keep go can you get the lock can you see what number to push your eye can you tell what number 2569 these be usually four digit code that give we 24 combination let us try it in reverse high probability all right who give you the flash drive I have a contact a voice on the phone when he need help he tell I where to pick thing up what about the terrorist do you know who hire they I assume it be just they somebody tip them off to what I be do okay your body 's in shock you really be a doctor it be not just a cover Yale medical school two year residency at Walter Reed Specialty in espionage I be always kind of a savant with word game and puzzle how many word can you make out of the letter in yoo hoo that kind of thing I be show off one day at Walter Reed and a CIA guy recruit I you do not feel that how bad the human response to a foreign object be to repel it and fight it like an infection but you be not human you have anthrocyte the file say they be design to keep your body from reject the bionic so they work to incorporate what be foreign and not repel it do not sound so bad the anthrocyte be move the bullet it could damage other organ I need to take it out now she could be dead no she be not she be still green it be your idea to send she in Jonas and you nearly get she execute you know the risk involve well than anyone buddy no willingly surrender a 50 million bionic woman be not in my play book well it get we inside to get Stevens and the flash drive you do not have the flash drive and you do not have Jaime well how about I get off the phone so I can go and find she you well and Antonio you treat she like she be expendable again I will not be this nice do not tell I how to do my job I be go to go and get your girl back carly what be you do here Nice to see you too seriously what be you do here be everything okay yeah I just borrow these from Jaime she home no she be in Napa with you excuse I exactly what be you look for what you promise Sarah Proof of Will 's upgrade you tell I to get her trust I be try to get her trust you do not trust I there be nothing here no file at all what be go on Jonas I do not know so you lie to I I tell you will be work on fix not that I have they apparently the file be on a flash drive in Paraguay how I do not think we know will as well as we think ah damn it sorry not what you want to be hear from your surgeon how you hold up I 've be sit here think about all the lie I 've be tell all the lie I 've be tell even to myself how do you make peace with it you do not you do what you can sometimes you pay a price three year ago a lie I decipher lead to a bombing raid in Iraq 87 civilian kill another 113 injure I be sorry so I come to triple border to atone Doctoring people who have nothing what about the CIA occasionally they ask a favor but now I only succeed at decipher those thing that I can live with if you have tell the terrorist what you know about I they might 've let you go yeah and I would have give they the technology to do what and then who would they have sell it to do the file say why it do that it stop after a few minute yeah what it be your bionic interface fail and be reset it keep happen it be inherent in the system and the anthrocyte function like an anti rejection drug but over time they become fatigued so they will replace they on the flash drive it talk about a five year projection until what bionic system cease to function what do that mean what do that mean you be go to die you can lead a horse to water but you can not make he drink so that be where we be start with horse Mr Ed will not drink you grab he by the mane force he under hold he there long enough he will swallow the point be to interpret the saying you do know your horse you and your sister have one when you be little be I right and Anne name it Coco whatever happen to Coco People who live in glass house should not throw stone or have sex without curtain I I like throw stone Wakes people up you be catch between a rock and a hard place now you be just try to be funny actually I be just try to do my job which as much as I do not like it mean try to

simple what be this student I D you be go to college you be transfer in from England how be your british accent okay these be the basic class you would 've have take as a transfer student in neurobiology Cellular neuroscience which be just about how neuron process physiological and electrochemical signal Glad that be all it be about Systems neuroscience which be just about how neuron you know form circuit can you just stop say which be just about this be an insane amount of information to process this quickly you just have to pull up that Harvard part of your brain the part that never go to Harvard be much big besides I be go to major in irish literature wow then you dodge a bullet when you do not go because you would 've end up a hundred grand in debt and still a bartender Science Jaime that be what pay the bill I be go to look like a total idiot you can not fake math and science okay okay okay just calm down go to college be a fantasy for I but in my fantasy I be hang out with intellectual people toss a frisbee around make a nice pot of Earl Grey and finish my dissertation on James Joyce wow we have very little in common and now I be go to look like a total idiot fake my way through cellular neuron science physio yeah neuroscience yeah you could wear glass then you would look smart thank you Nathan for that completely unhelpful suggestion just do my job thank you

worry it be an analog circuit we can override that easy schmeezy can you find the contact by the way why be you use the accent with I I be a method actor Fine by I it be literally the hot thing ever find them okay you got to put something metal between the contact point to keep the circuit from break like a paperclip or a hairpin or a steel bar okay give I the code 3qr4561 I be here I be in what do I do Computer let us start scan we need to get the dirt on Samuels so I be a glorify fax machine come on do not sell yourself short you can also open can we need to find out who he may have contact about the neural implant okay old journal article MPTP neurotoxicity apparently the guy be a pioneer in Parkinson 's simulation there be some grant application wait synthetic neurotransducer that be it right Nathan no it look good now let us get out of there what be you do I be just curious about he I want to know how old he be Unbelievable Professor Samuels I know who you be Sean go back to my office and get start on the research while I talk to Ms Whyte I be well aware of every pharmaceutical company compete university and everyone else try to steal information from we I do not know what you be talk about I just transfer in from Oxford I do not care where you be from I just want to know what you be do in my lab Sir I 've want to be part of this program for year you know you be a pioneer in Parkinson 's simulation that be why I transfer here your work be cut edge and I make such an idiot of myself in class and someone say if I want to get back in the good book to clean out the

severe he could not hold a knife a fork drive a car that be amazing you think that be good watch this he can juggle Great no you be miss the point the neural implant not only reroute the pathway but
