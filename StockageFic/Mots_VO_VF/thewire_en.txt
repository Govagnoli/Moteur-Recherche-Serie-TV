whenever we win a fight what do the state 's attorney say he say it go to a grand jury that be he do Pontius Pilate the grand jury do not indict he look clean for pass the buck and if they do indict they will not criminal history on our three witness one long than the next drug weapon assault more drug shitbird throw dirt at good police just the same Lieutenant I want you to rethink whatever tactic lead you to send three plainclothe officer to do field interview at the high rise at 2 00 in the morning yes sir I take it your people have union counsel yes sir Sir I would request that pende the grand jury review Officer Pryzbylewski be place on administrative leave I can use he in office but we should not have he on the street until the grand jury sign off that be put our tail between our leg I think our official stance have to be he do nothing wrong out there a 14 year old be half blind and two of our be injure as well Goddamn right they be fucking shoot at we out there Bobby what do you think keep he off the street until it clear the courthouse okay then we will wait on the grand jury Lieutenant a moment please what happen out there do you know they be in the high rise without backup if I tell you yes I screw up if I tell you no I be put my man in the jackpot do you still want I to answer I screw up sir good man willing to take one for the company to hell with the company I be defend my own people here that be all what Major Valchek mean to say be that he be grateful that you extend your support on behalf of Officer Pryzbylewski Fuck up that he be he should be off the street what can I say the kid need a little guidance a little supervision Stan here think that if he get a young officer back on the street where he might start over a new unit a new lieutenant you know that it might bring he around I understand he mess up here I understand that which be why I be say to you I owe you for walk he through this grand jury thing and to compensate Southeastern be send you two new unmarked unit and a surveillance van plus you need manpower while these guy be busy with this lid thing all you do be ask Lieutenant so I 've get suction with you Valchek that be what I be say Deputy always a pleasure a necessary evil what Valchek be it insubordinate if I ask what be so necessary thank for not cut Pryzbylewski loose if you have the department would be catch between Valchek and city hall I owe you for that this Barksdale he be dig in it may take more than buy bust and since it be be in the press about the witness it be not an issue keep it a tight little circle give I three week of good street work and you will see this through a couple of felony warrant a little dope on the table that be all we need here under no circumstance be it accurate to suggest that this particular homicide be the result of the victim having be a witness in an early case report to the contrary be without factual merit be you say that you know definitely that this man be not kill because he testify we think that I mean that be we be look into the possibility that Mr Gant be involve in a street dispute which of course would have nothing to do with his be a witness in an unrelated case that conclude week ago but you have not develop a suspect at this time no we have not Bunk shame on you lad what do you expect he to do I do not know grab the mike shove Rawls to the ground declare that all of Baltimore should rise as one because they be murder witness in cold blood that sound more like one of your move be work on he two week we do not even have a photo it be fucking embarrassing Hey Pat we get a job for you guy to try to run down what be it we need a photo of this guy Barksdale we need to know what he look like so go down to the B of l you see that be the problem guy Barksdale 's never be arrest as an adult so we do not really have a b of I photo he have his juvenile record expunge so there be no photo there either then you be fuck yeah we be but see as we all come into work today I think let us try something different we know from his mother 's social service record that Barksdale grow up in Franklin Terrace right it occur to I be vaguely familiar with the high rise of West Baltimore that the housing project begin to take photo of every register resident as a security measure be I correct Detective Greggs yeah so you want we to go down to the housing department and pull his photo Excellent you know you and l we think as one we be like two horse together in a harness why do not you fucking do it yourself Sure if you do not mind sit in my desk review homicide folder take meticulous note try to run down a few new lead it be boring painstaking work but if you do not want to travel to the housing department I will switch with you fuck it Patrick Let us take a ride that be inspire I be a leader of man what be up with shop no re up why not 'cause we out of red cap Stink say we go to have a new package tomorrow new package yeah

violence when your demand be not meet this be who you be why should we believe your testimony then why believe anything you say that be up to you all really you say you be not here testify against the

work there she work with a bunch of russian girl last year for about three month think she will talk to I only if I ask she thank you Detective nothing furth anything more on redirect Miss Nathan no your Honor Let us take 10 minute and then run the closing argument I have every intention of begin tomorrow with jury instruction how have Omar do you do not see it not the cross that bad you have no problem no to start he want you to pay 5 400 then we talk he say no you pay just the 2 700 yeah I see how you talk but you will not pay the 2 700 instead you will get the money for the car that burn

shit all that rehab all they promise we talk about this no you talk I do not get a word in edgewise once you make up your mind I do not get a word in edgewise once you make up your mind where you go with you excuse I who know I might see a little something I happen to like so all of that be on the table there be money in the transport budget for the grain pier also a bond issue that pay for maintenance dredging on the main shipping channel but not the canal Nope not the canal for that we will have to fight a little long and dig a little deep so say Frank I get to say for my money we be lucky if we pull out the grain pier be that as it may we spend the money and take our good shot hire a couple lobbyist make some smart contribution pay for a consultant 's report to argue against some of the environmental stuff it cost but we be start to see it so where you all find the cash I 've be rob liquor store two a week seriously we get some help from the national office on this there 've be some timely donation from a few friend here and there the point be at the very least we be likely to see the grain pier back up by next year which mean a couple hundred more ship a year at least if and it be a big fucking if if that Polack motherfucker hey no offense if Krawczyk do not fuck we by throw up waterfront condominium first right Nat 's right the back door threat be that Andy Kraw or some other developer get enough last minute vote to sink the rehab money for the grain pier those guy be look at that location too so we need everybody make phone call let your legislator know that we be watch on this the money only go so far now we get to make some noise right make some noise okay enough talk some of youse get ship to work in the morning the rest of youse need to be drunk I will drink to that help from the national office huh timely donation from friend watch your ass Frank this be it yeah just pick it up from the port administrator so what be I look at the Atlantic Light on the day the can with the woman be offload the box be container this one be be offload and set on a chassis here be the time 10 31 hour see it be move to Lane L Stack 6 row 3 by an RTG at 10 37 hour RTG Rubber tire gantry so from ship to stack take six minute that be the way it be suppose to work but AQQZ as in zebra 396594 Check digit seven that be the container number of the can with the woman in it see that it be never enter by the checker so as far as the computer be concern it no long exist Sobotka say that that can happen when the radio wave get knock down or when a checker input a bad serial number it come off Atlantic Light at 1 1 26 hour and it do not show up in the computer again until 15 1 2 hour I find it two hour after that so for nearly four hour it be out on the dock unaccounted for Sobotka say can get lose all the time when they get find they get put back into the computer you believe he no not this can so what be the plan the database on this computer have record for every ship that berth at Patapsco over the last two year we get to go back through and find what other can might 've disappear like that see if there be a pattern how many ship we talk about hundred it be not like I get a prayer of bring this case in otherwise that be what I be talk about all right what the hell be your problem nothing yeah you look like you about to be sick or something I just can not look at they Prez you be not never be to a titty bar yeah sure but not with woman you be sure you be not go to have a problem for talk to we I do not give a shit you friend with Shardene all that matter besides I be from Westport and I tell they club owner straight up I be here before they ho 's get here and they well make sure I be here after they leave so how long ago

stay where they tell Shit they be not here legally they do not know shit they be not get no family the man they got handle they be always with they right there to take they from whatever motel they

go to schedule sentencing for the third week of next month anything else today your Honor my client having preserve the necessary ground for appeal in the record wish I to state unequivocally that regardless of this jury 's verdict he be the victim of wholesale perjury on the part of the state 's key witness we ask that an appeal bond be set so that he can participate fully in this investigation an appeal bond on a conviction of first degree murder Mr Levy get a grip on yourself your Honor not only will there be no bond pende sentencing but as far as I be concern the pre sentencing report be a mere formality Mr Hilton have be find guilty of kill a state 's witness who testify in this very courtroom he do so in cold blood and for pay unless the pre sentence report indicate that he be in fact the Messiah come again he will very likely be sentence to life no parole by a Baltimore judge who for once in his life get to leave his office feeling that his job actually matter Mr Hilton be you the second coming of our savior excuse I be you Jesus Christ come back to Earth see you at sentencing be it good for you too Mr Little this be good to get out of jail free one

get out for the racetrack piece what about art for the Hopkins press conference do we get that scratch it for racetrack Hey Swag it be I again something be on fire over in east Baltimore surprise I with a nice pretty picture huh look what we have be drug violence and plenty of it what you have be federal gun statute that come with a 5 year minimum no parole and we need to lower our murder rate especially since you short your police department budget it be no secret we have budget problem all the more reason for the U S Attorney to pitch in officially my priority be counterterrorism and political corruption so you tell I when I ask you for help on those body in the vacant house but I be inclined to provide you with a dozen FBI agent and all the wherewithal they need to work that case but we want Clay Davis to go federal our state 's attorney have develop that case he decide what to do with it he seem inclined to keep Mr Davis local at this point but if you could convince Mr Bond to reconsider we might find the resource not only for the probe of the row house body but the time to run some of those gun case for you but unless you get Clay Davis you be willing to let the killing continue look the FBI and the U S Attorney 's office be not here to do the job that your police department can not do not blame we for your ineffectiveness Baltimore be knee deep in blood unless this guy can hang a democratic legislator he could not give a damn and to protect that legislator who happen to be one of the most corrupt extortion artist in the state you will burn every last bridge do you think I give a shit about Clay Davis I be not protect he then give he up it be Bond 's call talk to he I have and he tell your republican ass to go fuck itself huh well let I double down on that good luck with your crime problem that go well you know why he want the Clay Davis investigation so bad so he can stomp all over the democratic party and help give his asshole republican golf buddy another 4 year in the Governor 's mansion so Bond be keep the case local to help the party huh no Bond be keep the case so that Clay Davis can be a trophy for bond my guess be our newly elect state 's attorney want to one day run for Mayor cut both way for you Naresse if the feds get Clay Davis then the case do not give bond any profile but if they get he and flip he Clay might take half the Royce administration with he you include maybe do not you worry about I you on the other hand just slam the door on the feds and we need all the help we can get that be on they Pussy call I be just glad to know Marlo have a hobby here take she to her room you know let she hit the mini bar watch tv when she be settle go take care of the other thing I use Monk for my ride all right then move on to new

ordinarily so but here we get some of our east side people be displace right I think we need to take care of those most affected mean you well I be east side for the most part but I be talk about

for state desk additional cutback be say to be come in the city MTA route trail balloon from the governor affect a lot of people no if it happen they float this once before still we can go outside and give they the potential impact the truth be we be follow the Daily Record on this one why do not we have that if it be a trial balloon we 've be without a transport reporter since the last round of buyout so we should pick that up probably so but just because Chicago do a little belt tighten there be no reason for we to fall down their cutback there should not affect our ability to put out an excellent product simply have to do more with less certainly we have more resource than the Daily Record though not a transport reporter your eminence slum at the Metro meeting today what do you know

description and the use of the number 12 well let us just say we need to find whoever it be make both those call he make another call Detective as a newsman I be inclined to include these detail in our coverage if there be a credible chance the killer be really in contact with our reporter would do so have any negative effect on your investigation actually these call be our good mean of find this guy every call he make every word he say to you and to we can only provide information if we do run a story but you can not say he be contact police you can not print that part of it under any

have more of it than even Lester could use to be that close to a serial killer it must be weird Kinda yeah wonderful story Scott yeah well it kinda write itself it be a lucky thing to have the guy call I like he do it come from you pound the pavement right that be more than luck that be put yourself in the place where the story come to you what do you have for tomorrow for tomorrow this be not the kind of thing we let go of after a day or two I you know I be think that if I spend a night with the homeless you know do what they do saw what they see that kind of thing I mean if it be an overnight thing I could not get it for tomorrow but the next day sure that be great that could be the perfect follow I will speak to Gus also Scott we 've be take call from some of the national network and cable outlet they be look for want you to go on camera I on television I would avoid the local but if you can do the nationalstuff in a responsible maner Sure yeah I mean I be just not all that comfortable have myself in the center of the story like this of course not but there be a way of handle this responsibly I think just remember you be an ambassador for the paper Star time yeah how 'bout that Homelessness our coverage should reflect the dickensian aspect of the homeless the human element Scott will lead it off spend a night on the street and write from that perspective he be the lead on your education project we need to get he back on the I do not see the the school project as yield the same kind of impact as our attention to homelessness can these murder the phone call to our reporter it really open up the issue do not you think yeah but from now til the end of the year let us focus not only on cover the murder but on the the nature of homelessness itself the dickensian aspect of it yeah I 've reach a point detective Sydnor where I no long have the time or patience leave to address myself to the need of the system within which we work I be tired you be go to quit not yet not just yet so what be you talk about when they take we off Marlo this last time when they say they could not pay for further investigation I regard that decision as illegitimate Illegitimate and so I be respond in kind I be go to press a case against Marlo Stanfield without regard to the usual rule I be run an illegal wiretap on Marlo Stanfield 's cellphone Fuck Lester if you have a problem with this I understand completely and urge you to get as far fucking away from I as you can you remember this one here back away from jackin ' the boy up outta respect for that goofy motherfucker pryzbylewski Wonder what the young man might tell I a year later though Bunk what the fuck be this Vernon here do a search warrant on his dead guy 's appliance store pull all of that out of the desk drawer Grand jury shit transcript seal indictment who be your murder eastside dealer by the name of Joe Stewart catch one in the back of his head the other night somebody finally touch prop Joe huh you remember when narcotic indict Charlie Burman last year Motherfucker run a couple day before the raid still on the wing the sealed indictment be all in there every one of them who do not we trust at the courthouse they put cheese on they fry they can Chili too alright then you want a drink with that Strawberry lemonade alright I be on it they be back on cellphone after more than a year that they be tell I they be talk in code Lester I wanna go to jail for snatchin ' something well than Marlo Stanfield 's fucking lunch order there be no code that I can tell I 've get a half dozen call all routine no drug talk no number no time nothing but what they seem so he be not do business with the phone then so take this mess down let us get the fuck outta here I also have five call thirty to forty second duration each one pick up on the first ring each one with nothing whatsoever say between party you see when they talk it be bullshit but there be call where no one say a thing thirty second without conversation be he we talk it through he know the risk I be in if it make the fucking case I be in all the way so what be up now they talk dirt no Lester Fuck Marlo 's not go to talk dirt on the phone but there be something to this I just have not figure it out we could use some more manpower we need a couple of surveillance team to get on these guy to see how they use the phone you see the newspaper today Headline like that the boss be go to start throw money at the homeless murder when they do I will peel off a couple detective throw they your way the homeless murder how do that case tangle in with this hard to explain remember what the D N C folk tell I two year ago what I need to do to take the statehouse build something downtown and stick your name on it get the crime to go down and stay away from school and keep my boyish good look one out of four be not bad Jesus do we have to schedule this the same day as new Westport my good news be not even go to make the front of the local section the ribbon cutting be schedule two week ago this homeless thing no one see come first of all I be surprised to see so much medium here a press event hold early today to announce the revitalization of yet another part of our city be not so well attend it would appear that medium attention be always focus on the negative when it come to Baltimore but you guy be not around when we be make real progress nevertheless I be glad to see so many of you here some of you represent not just our local medium but national attention to this problem thank you for care enough about our most vulnerable citizen to address yourself to this tragedy our homeless citizen those who have fall through the crack of our society those who command the least of our attention and effort they seemingly have little to endear themselves to politician they do not vote by and large they do not contribute to campaign they offer little to a city 's tax base and to the extent that our government be make aware of their existence it respond by try to mitigate the damage do by their presence we open a food bank here a shelter there we try to move they away from downtown away from our communal area away from our school away from our home if you be to judge our society by the manner in which we treat those lose on our street we would have cause to be shame well I be God forgive I a politician but I be also someone who run for public office because I believe that there be a different way of govern and I believe that in the end we will be judge not by the effort we make on behalf of those who vote for we or those who contribute to our campaign or those who provide for our tax base I believe that we will be judge by what we provide to the weak and most vulnerable that be the test that be my test somebody be kill homeless man in this city they be take the life of fellow citizen who do not have the mean or the strength to properly protect themselves they will be stop we will do everything in our power to stop they you have my word on this thank you Mr Mayor what get into you what I want to assure the public that we be do everything possible in our power to apprehend this subject Homicide detective be work around the clock District officer be in contact with the agency that work with the homeless I can not go into specific of the investigation but with that caveat I will take question Commissioner be there any connection 1between these murder and those in the vacant home last year no connection Commissioner be you ask the F B I to join in the investigation I think deputy Commissioner Daniels be in a position to elaborate on that we will take whatever help be offer certainly our detective will work closely with the behavioral analysis unit at Quantico Deputy even with all the resource at your disposal be not it extremely difficult to catch a serial killer our ability to secure genetic material and the grow d N A Data bank be asset unavailable to we even a few year ago and our ability to effectively use resource have be increase with the aid of sophisticated computer software and of course we have some of the good criminal investigator in the nation work 24 7 as the mayor make very clear a moment ago this be now a priority for the department have a note be find at any of the scene I be not at liberty to go into any detail of the investigation at this time you want I to hang he tell you who I be right Son the thing about murder be it never go off the book I mean we work on them for week month year we keep on with it until finally someone decide they 've have enough until we get the right word from the right person and you know what happen then when a case do go down all those people who keep quiet about it who lie about it all of they who think it be not come back on them they end up catchin ' a charge and they get time behind that time huh you go to give I time if you know something about that boy lex getting shoot now be your last chance to speak to that you give a statement last year why do not you promise to get I outta here that be what you all do lie to dumbass nigger Yo you all need to get this police out my face before I bank his ass you be a natural kiddo you have they eat out of your hand Shit I be just follow the mayor 's lead he want a full court press right we can add a detective or two and you can ask patrol to concentrate where vagrant congregate but other than that deputy the cupboard be bare but Carcetti say make no mistake he want we to solve the murder he just do not want it to cost do not look so shocked you be runnin ' with the big dog now be not it enough that we be up on the killer 's cellphone I would think that you could track he on the G P S chip alone he be use a burner and we suspect he be take out the battery between call and there be nothing to stop he from change phone call the reporter from a new number so you want to tap the reporter 's phone as well it stand to reason that we should monitor this thing from both end it be what we would normally do nothing about this be normal a Baltimore Sun reporter 's phone be problematic we need to strike a bance between your need as investigator and the first amendment right of the Sun and its source the first amendment do not guarantee privacy your honor legal precedent clearly indicate Look I be not say that we can not but but what until we get the sense that your suspect be change phone I be not inclined to look with favor on tap the Baltimore Sun 's telecommunications we be afraid to piss they off never pick a fight with anyone who buy ink by the barrel full Christ very well judge how many enemy do you need Deputy where do you get all this darling you do not want to know what be up with you get all twenty two out of the drawer huh Workin ' the whole mess at once I be try to see them fresh twenty five my triple it come back to Marlo and his people for sure a good informant tell I so say one of my vic be talk bad about Mr Stanfield who take it personal kill he his girl his muscle leave the little kid alive so I guess he be not all bad People out there so scared of this motherfucker I can not get close to an eyewitness on any of it where you at with the rest of these case we do not even have lab work on fourteen of these body a year later and I be still walk in write request into Landsman watch he just file they away in his drawer McNulty would 've call a news reporter on that shit I be not he what would the Bunk do take no for a fucking answer we have cutback you know that we

she be assign to sort and file the individual trace element Hair fiber mostly you know from each of the fourteen scene so what be the problem in the initial paperwork you guy write out all twenty two

the single complaint number you do not fuckin ' mean yeah we have no idea which one of your scene any of this shit come from we do not have a clue actually except for this she be be a pretty good employee surveillance team two each on twelveour shift I need they to set up on certain location common to our case come on Jay you hear the mayor this case be a red ball that it be you can have Greggs if you want the last time I offer she up you kick she back to her own casework other than a second detective you be on your own so it be all bullshit I dunno I think the mayor give a very nice

with he what about the neighborhood beat the homeless coverage you be cover take a couple week see what you see a ight late entry from the copshop two dead in a Charles county housefire and a homicide from the city Ettlin what do we get room for we be shy one brief in the metro digest four paragraphs'll fill what be the homicide the 34 year old black male shoot dead in West Baltimore grocery Juvenile suspect be be seek write up the fire Scratch the murder we do not have room so what we conclude from a behavioral analysis of the known forensic be the follow the suspect be likely a white male in his late twenty to late thirty he likely be not a college graduate but feel nonetheless superior to those with advanced education and he be likely employ in a bureaucratic entity possibly civil service or quasi public service from which heeel alienate he have a problem with authority and a deep seat resentment of those who he feel have impede his progress professionally the minimized sexual activity suggest that this be not a primary motive for the killing in fact the bite mark in the last find victim lack the d N A of saliva indicate to we possible post mortem stage the suspect have trouble with last relationship and be possibly a high function alcoholic with alcohol be utilize as a trigger in the commission of these crime his resentment of the homeless may stem from a personal relationship with someone who be in that cohort or his victimization of vagrant might merely present an opportunity for he to assert his superiority and intellectual prowess if you get more fax it down and we can update the profile thank for everything thank so what do you think they be in the ballpark look congressman I will do whatever it take to make thing right between we but run

kill any homeless man no serial killer some be random killing some be natural death that be likely manipulate but they be not link in any way but why the detective use the money to fund a case against the drug trafficker responsible for the slaying in the vacant a year ago last week 's arrest and seizure be a direct result so let I just understand this so I 've be go out there for week slamming the governor for his neglect of the Homeless and declare how we will stop at nothing to findhe person responsible for Preying on the homeless and all the while hey norman this be my ass here that be true boss but it do have a certain charm to it they manufacture an issue to get pay we manufacture an issue to get you elect governor everybody 's gettin ' what they need behind some make believe the detective involve will be suspend and ultimately fire at the least beyond that a criminal prosecution on fraud and perjury charge be probable so what you be say we call a press conference and we say hey by the way all that stuff about homeless people getting kill and the governor cut the safety net and we do everything in our power to catch the guy hey guess what the joke 's on we not to mention that the evidence against the trafficker arrest last week be taint that case could collapse as well I do not fucking believe this you two be on point here Word of this get down to annapolis the governor 's go to wreck I with it and if it come to that you guy drop on your sword so help I how do word not get out once we suspend the detective never mind send it to the grand jury the cop that do this they get to go you can not be tell I I have to live with this Deputy counselor if you two will excuse we we be go to discuss this first as a matter of public policy until we can reason the good way to address this do nothing and speak to no one about any of this if this become public in the wrong way a lot of people who be legally responsible for the situation good people who be nonetheless in a supervisory role here be go to suffer and that be not the outcome that anyone want what mike be say be that we need to be very careful about how to proceed I wish I be still at the newspaper so I could write on this mess it be too fuckin ' good Www Wikisubtitles Net Www Thewire France Com the wire 5x10 60 series finale 30 Www Ncicap Org Www Hbo Com thewire the life of king H L Mencklen Lester

anyone who have the smell of this on they should be go before the close of business they should be suspend and before the end of the week indict I know but but what we be go to let this shit stand

take we all off the hook the long this go on the bad the payback 's go to be the bad the payback 's go to be but what do he really know what he know now be not half of what he will learn when we get to discovery they will not be able to produce a credible source of information they do not have to if it be not a register c I a source of information be only if he can raise doubt in a judge 's mind we could be compel to reveal our source at that point we be give up the wiretap and he get the paperwork from the phone company which have stanfield 's number on it God the only thing we can do be barter then barter this can not go to court we do have some leverage what let us just say mr Levy have problem of his own to deal with make this go away and the mayor will not forget that you do so

Partlow plead to all of the body in the vacant and take life no parole we would want the second shooter too but pearson be beyond that now metcalf and wagstaff plead to possession with intent Stanfield take ten year on conspiracy you be blackmail an officer of the court the moment you come in here and offer that quid pro quo you be guilty of obstruction of justice you be right I could get six to eight year and for bribery of a state 's attorney and the violation of grand jury secrecy you could see ten to twelve I will be out a couple year before you maury you come home first round be on I I guess so you will let I walk to keep this case out of open court that file must be dirty as hell huh the conspiracy charge on stanfield fall without the cell phone and you and I both know that if someone do some dig they be go to find an illegal wiretap and you be go to lose the phone Everhart two Seventy Four Maryland four Fifty Nine or ceccolini four thirty five U S Two Sixty Eight lie cop do not automatically kill a case but that be a lot of risk on appeal and a lot of dirt for your office to show no you be scared of the light Partlow take his chance on the legit murder charge only the conspiracy count go and stanfield and the rest walk Stanfield walk but the case go on the stet docket not dismiss outright and although I can tell you there be people in this city who can not tolerate a scandal at this particular moment that dynamic change after november the election after november no one be go to care as much about show dirt if carcetti win he be in annapolis if he lose he be an incumbent mayor who can take a hit or two so you tell mr Stanfield that this be his only window Partlow plead to all the murder and both lieutenant plead to the drug then stanfield retire he be do we even get the scent of he on the street ever again this case come off stet and go to trial and if we have to put a few cop in jail right behind he so be it we will bring the evidence and take a hit your client walk away now or the both of you do not walk at all let us go get up that be mine it be yours I know do you have a card that be not a card we meet before you remember Liar Black liar

Chris eat the murder every last one take life with no parole no parole no shot but they 've get he cold on the one with the d N A can you sell that be chris loyal yeah as long as I take care ofis people Cheese and monk be look at up to twenty for the drug but there be go to be no asset investigation and you come home with all your money why they let I walk they do not want to but there be some shit in their case and they would rather not show it in court but here be the rub if you stay in the game they will they definitely will right now with an election go on they be willing to give you a buy but after november if they even think you be still a player they can take this case down off the shelf and the shit in the case might not be enough to keep you free do you understand give up the crown well that be the deal kiddo there be not a lawyer who could get well for you how would that go boss Kiddo you be a goldmine to I you know that you 've take this law firm to a whole new level I you do not tip I to that bad wiretap I 've get all kind of trouble but now if marlo take the deal he be go to get a walk after be charge in a multimillion dollar drug seizure that do not happen very often and when it do happen the name and number of the defense attorney go in the front Pocket of every respectable drug trafficker you be a genius for what you bring I on this I be just doing what I

have be apprehend by the diligent effort of investigator Mr Mayor be he be charge with all of the murder or just two um it be my understanding that uh uh we be charge the last two incident but it be my understanding that he be suspect in all of the crime and we be wait for dna test result Indications be that he may be mentally incapacitate and therefore additional prosecution would prove redundant I would also like to credit deputy commissioner for Operations daniel with not only bring these case to their proper conclusion but but also for solve last year 's slaying in the vacant rowhouse he have give we such excellent work that I think that now be as good a time as any to announce that we will be send the deputy 's name forward to the city council for confirmation as

for Duquan right I take it to he Gimme Hey Crystal Miss Donnelly say to give you these okay I will be right down what and for either of my opponent to suggest that downtown development come at the expense of our city 's neighborhood well that be just unfair and uh divisive for they to suggest that my administration have not be responsive well economic development can not be a band aid it be a long term process that require commitment to retrain our workforce and as I say before this can only be successful in a city where people feel safe so before we can even begin to think about iure new industry to Baltimore we need to think about how we can make these neighborhood and this city safe once again Mr Carcetti may think it be in his interest to exploit people 's fear he be be do it throughout this campaign I be offend by it personally but the fact be that violent crime be down citywide and our police department be work hard to keep it that way and will continue to do so under my administration Councilman Carcetti you have two minute to respond do anyone in this room really believe that crime be down in Baltimore you call I a liar Tommy Gentleman please no personal interaction Councilman Carcetti can the mayor honestly tell the people of Rosemont of Belair Edison of Highlandtown or Cherry Hill there be less drug deal less violence any statistic come from the police department can not be trust because under this mayor the police be more concerned with protect Clarence Royce politically than fight crime there be no leadership and morale have never be low I will change that it be business as usual down at City Hall and as a result our response to crime have be characterize time and time again by wanton indifference 32 yard what do I mean by business as usual what do I mean by wanton indifference well last night in West Baltimore on Lanvale Street another citizen be shoot and kill this time the victim be a key witness in a drug case that have yet to come to court courageously this man have agree to testify in two week time in that case the police should have be protect he they be not and he be murder oh shit why because this mayor you be prime time Eddie would not spend the money to protect he now I have no doubt that in a moment or two Clarence Royce will accuse I of exploit this man 's death for my own political purpose but the truth be a year ago I write the mayor a letter I have copy for anyone who want one I beg he to spend the money and make witness protection a priority he ignore I I even team up with our legislative leader Delegate Watkins and other to get match fund for witness protection approve in Annapolis and incredibly those matching fund be never claim by this administration now to mention this now may be exploitive I do not know I only know it be true and on such truth I ask the voter of our city to consider a change folk please please hold your applause until after the round of question be over Mayor Royce no more surprise huh I be unaware of the specific of the incident to which Councilman Carcetti be refer uh so I can not answer that directly um however I can say that this city place the high priority on protect those citizen who come forward to testify and we will continue to do so Mr Carcetti state that he write a letter express his concern and I be sure that he do I mean it be it be it be easy enough to write letter when all you have to do be write letter but when you be require to run a city on limited resource and balance priority well then well then you understand that write letter will not solve the problem oh no Shit girl you know I be a roll wit ' you huh I need some kinda break Mm hmm oh shit Ai not nothing bad than they bitch with fuck up nail at the blackjack table you know hold on you think my son go to go up to that school lookin ' like himself and I do not believe we can get a handle on crime until we get a handle on the school because we need to be think about these

Attorney General 's job start the turnover it be kill we this would be the time to do it I mean we be over the revenue expect for this point in the fiscal year next to the real estate market how much past 'cause l want to come out of the box with a big bump in police salary in particular the commissioner 's salary which need to jump like 50 grand well a good guess would be a one shot surplus of about 20 million but that be rainy day money for more than crime Word around North Avenue be that the school be run a deficit excuse I do you say a 50 000 bump for Ervin Burrell well no not for Burrell per se oh for the next police commissioner then that be what you mean well look ahead it make sense because fire Burrell would upset a good sized block of my constituency not to mention the minister and I think the budget chair might have a difficult time allow a high salary to be approve in fact I can guarantee if that proposal 's in the budget your first for the record the bill will not come out of committee intact I be just say that in the event Commissioner Burrell be to leave we would want to bump that salary in order to attract the good candidate in particular the good african american candidate from across the nation with three year leave in his term why would he leave Councilman what may not have be obvious to you on the Public Safety Subcommittee be that the budget process be a carefully orchestrate ballet a cooperative effort between the branch of government well Madam President the nuance of that cooperative effort be begin to come into focus for I

time exactly it do not happen this morning this be on Royce 's watch you do not get a whiff of this during council review you can not blame the council or Royce for the school budget the fiscal responsibility be with the school board itself but the council do have oversight do not even pretend to put this shit on I only the city share show up on our budget review we never see the state money you would well tell your pretty new chief of staff that whatever happen up on North Avenue be on the school system that be a simplistic view I think how would you complicate it as president of the school board I will argue this be a bookkeeping issue we 've simply be roll the system 's debt over since ' 99 you roll it and roll it until it run out of cash that be not bookkeepe that be stupidity so what be we talk about here waste Fraud Embezzlement I would say that although the system have some poor accounting practice in the end we be go to find that most of the money be properly spend on programming okay okay okay we get it no one 's responsible not the school board not anybody on North Avenue not Clarence Royce not the city council no one at this table fine so what be our next move bump the property tax rate Scale back our budget no pay hike hire freeze reduce service tell everyone school police fire public work they have to hold the line for a year or two how I just run a clean

test in sample a we start with Kid 's right this be bullshit the test material do not exactly speak to their world yeah do not speak too loud to mine either an estimate Detective we start open those house we might turn over a couple of dozen body but that be just I guess all of they homicide the boy take over half the West Side we never see the violence this right here be the reason why you be ask we to call out half of public work and pull the plywood off thousand of vacant house all so we can raise the city 's murder rate by 10 what else be we do on Stanfield I be try to get backup on his people 's cell phone as fast as I can and I start to look for his money but if I be right about this they have to be work be there any evidence at all that link all these missing person report to the Stanfield organization I be just start at that the one body that we pull out of the Fulton Avenue house be Lex his case be a direct tie and there be two other name on those miss person report that show up in our wiretap from early this year so yes there be link Counselor by any chance do Landsman run this up the chain to you guy no your call my office will not care until they see case file I will run it upstairs and we will see what come okay I get it he be still tie up but it really should only be a little while long can you tell the governor I have to go back to Baltimore I have a little bit of business today I be the mayor of a major american city for chrissake how much shit do l have to eat from this guy would not you play the politic if you be he it be not like the state have no role in this thing you know the state money for those school have no oversight either but I be not tell the Washington fucking Post talk about how he might be force to bail I out because what be the quote again because those be my child in Baltimore too he be go to bleed I for that money Mayor Carcetti the governor 's office say he be ready to see you now 54 million be a big number we will

into those house because if there be body in there they need to come out but do it now I do not want to be find any more body come January yes sir Mr Mayor sir Choice come down to this we take the state money and instead of be fuck up and break our school go back to be merely fuck up no teacher layoff no program cut no school closure but the price the governor 's asking be more state control over the school board and change in the teacher ' union contract that would allow they to remove tenure faculty for cause Ouch if we do not take the money it look like we be short our kid we take the money we be give up local control of education which be go to lose we a lot of middleclass black folk not to mention the problem you might have two year from now run in the D c suburb explain how you

out there I know he will your turn girl it be a bout time for real for starter its memory hold the last 10 call make and receive by the user that be enough to give we a signature signature the phone number unique to an individual that way we can identify the user when he switch to another phone sorry I be late wake up in the wrong town anyway we run the toll on those number and we come up with a rather interesting pattern check this out this be the pattern of a clod communication network something you would expect from a drug organization this particular one so far involve 15 distinct burner 15 and none of they list subscriber information you can do that with these burner with this particular company you do not need subscriber information our datum show that over 92 of the call be make within this network with the average call last less than a minute again suggestive of drug trafficking this user here he serve as a clearing house he receive call and initiate interaction he coordinate the show be nice if that be Stringer now this be the good part this be something that Prez discover when he be play with it it have a speed dial feature Meaning someone take the time to program the phone Hell that be probably the only way these corner boy can remember all the number what with these phone be dump every few day or so I will bet all the other phone in the network be set up the same way well I 've hear enough we should start write for the wire when can we get up get up on what they be dump phone every couple week on average by the time you get a wire up on that the phone be dead the whole network shut down simultaneously do we have a plan not yet we do not but for now if I could get a couple more of these dead phone it will probably help corroborate the theory for the affidavit Kima maybe you could ask those western boy to pick up what they find on the ground for the next few day yeah sure Damn boy you smell like sex you do not take a fucking shower late

possibility of a statistical variation from the mean in his monthly stat Variation huh gentleman if I look through the western incident report be I likely to find less crime or more incident which have be downgrade or unfounded because this kind of variation scream manipulation to I and if I be wrong about that if indeed there be no manipulation involve I would like to know exactly what it be that Major Colvin have learn about police work that elude the rest of your commander Councilman I assure you these stat be not massage we do not do that I do not do that and I will not allow my people to do that our feeling be that it be genuinely an aberration and if it repeat itself next month then it bear close examination otherwise move on to new business then how be we fix for witness assistance do the department have sufficient fund to ensure pre trial security for any endanger witness we have the resource that the city can afford I be sure I understand you be in no position to criticize the Mayor nor would I nor would you so allow I to ask the question what be this city willing to pay to make it possible for ordinary people to come down to the courthouse and perform the civic duty of bear witness against gangster and criminal what resource be commensurate with that kind of commitment you can play the good soldier if you want Commissioner but I want to go on the record here in say that this administration have pass the buck time and again and fail to protect those citizen who demonstrate that kind of commitment and put their life and livelihood at risk and I

that be the second crib of mine they motherfucker crack this week stir up a hornet 's nest no tellin ' who go to get sting all paranoid an ' shit get to be they get Latroy what the fuck be you all on the street for man do not you all know there be a fucking war go on man get the fuck in the truck man what happen to all they tower slow train comin ' Reform Lamar Reform reformation we should be up on this shit hearin ' voice we get a signature number on Bodie 's phone we will be we get enough p c off the burner alone every time these fucking pen register click out a call it scream drug conspiracy I be not the one takin ' the case to court Pearlman want a specific link to a know drug trafficker these drug crew they be dump phone every couple week at well so when we do get a wire up it be go to be a limited run and dump phone do not meet the cellular company 's definition of exigent circumstance huh what be your boss willing to do Demper he be a bit too focused on next year 's re election fight how about the fed they say they can not do anything for we and if you look at how they use the federal communications act they be not lie for national security stuff they use the Patriot Act every thing else get shorted the fact be the industry have all of we by the ball Pardon my french your Honor Alright I will tell you what Best I can do for you be this you give I a boilerplate affidavit with the p C from the court report and then as you get fresh number for new disposable you call I anytime day or night to jump phone that help but we be still go to be get up on their phone even as they be come down yeah probably so this be so totally fuck up Je parle français bien et tu es très charmant aujourd'hui Judge Phelan have you on his mind how long have that be go on start with my first jury trial in his court I think I bet you win all your motion you want to see I sir have a seat I wanna thank you for the loyalty you show move that body it be not the most sensible thing but I appreciate it nonetheless you be a good man Sergeant you get good instinct and as far as I can tell you be a decent supervisor but from where I sit you be not shit when it come to policin ' do not take it personal be not just you it be all our young police a whole generation of you all now you think about it you be here over a year now Carver you get nobody look out for you nobody willing to talk to you that about sum it up and that be a problem and I do not think there be anyway I be ever go to get my head around it but then Dozerman gets shoot for some bullshit and that be when I 'bout reach my limit and that be when the idea of the free zone of Hamsterdam come to I because this drug thing this be not police work no it be not I mean I can send any fool with a badge and a gun up on those corner and jack a crew and grab vial but police you call something a war and pretty soon everybody go to run around act like warrior they go to be runnin ' around on a damn crusade stormin ' corner slappin ' on cuff rackin ' up body count and when you at war you need a fuckin ' enemy and pretty soon damn near everybody on every corner be your fuckin ' enemy and soon the neighborhood that you be suppose to be policin ' that be just occupy territory you follow this I think so look the point I be makin ' Carver be this soldierin ' and policin ' they be not the same thing and before we go and take the wrong turn and start with these war game the cop walk a beat and he learn that post and if there be thing that happen up on that post whether there be a rape a robbery a shooting he have people out there help he feed he information but every time I come to you my d e u sergeant for information to find out what be go on out there on they street all that come back be some bullshit you have your stat you have your arrest you have your seizure but do not none of that amount to shit when you talk about protect a neighborhood now do it you know the bad thing about this so call drug war to my mind it just ruin this job Major what do you get Incoming Sunpapers reporter be to the free zone all three of them it be begin I be thinkin ' maybe we rewrite the affidavit add some of the stuff we be gettin ' from the pen register build the case that way take it to the judge you have a law degree if you do it would be your call to make who would pretend to be a lawyer that be not I be just say I think we be be too cautious on this we be go the extra mile for Phelan a short cut now could cost we later in motion hearing we draw Phelan on this wiretap that two faced hack sell I out the last go round relax he be not run for a new term he will be fine he be a piece of shit we be all piece of shit when we be in your way that go with the territory point take so it be these warehouse the old Winchester home and the dead block down by Vincent Street all three and they be just suppose to let it go on like this Colvin tell we to push the street deal in these area then we would start lock people up but so far not a single fucking arrest and they know about this downtown I do not think they have a fucking clue about it but I would love to be there when you pop the question this be just tell I about it get the place lookin ' good yeah now all need doing be to go out and get you some kid come on man you makin ' it sound easy but to tell you the truth I be not get no idea how to go at these hopper I would not lose any sleep over that nobody else do neither we get one his grandmother look for I look boy there be no reason to leave your clothe in the washer how many damn time do I have to tell you Gag grandma sorry I just forget okay but I do pick up the laundry soap I pick it up laundry soap that be definitely code now let us listen to an

the street People down here do outreach give out needle and all I mean who know about this down at headquarters Command be well aware of the situation and while there be some initial concern but they feel the case that we be go to bring in case yeah prosecution sure your officer say no one be be lock up in the free zone my troop be only involve in push the trafficking to designate area I mean they be completely ignorant of the investigative aspect that be run out of c I D downtown yeah who be the lead detective Look I already say more than I should bottom line be you start throw call around

be huh this be from Major Colvin 's CI what be the corroboration well the source know that Barksdale have a waterfront condo in his own name give the accurate location and title info down to deed of

explain the murder what be in the wire Loose talk about how it be Marlo 's people but nothing past rumor with Bell go Barksdale might have to come down a notch to oversee the day to day and maybe that put he in contact with some of our monitored cell phone if he be as cautious as Stringer maybe not my guess be Barksdale never touch a cell phone Safe house might be our good shot all right we stay on

superior officer and for five week all evidence of what he be do manage to elude the entire command staff be you kid Commissioner I take full responsibility and indeed after I first learn of the matter I inform the Mayor and together we move immediately to relieve Major Colvin I be under the impression that this administration give serious consideration with Colvin 's initiative no sir Major Colvin inform you of his effort at a COMSTAT meeting more than a week ago his free zone stay up for six day after that that be my responsibility Councilman we need the time to conclude an ongoing investigation by the Major Crime Unit a wiretap case that would have be disrupt Correct Mayor Royce be aware of the pende case and allow we to delay our response accordingly but the Mayor be unequivocal in his opposition to what Major Colvin do what we have here I be afraid be nothing more complicated than a solitary police commander who under great pressure prove to be amoral incompetent and unfit for command no it be about more than that this be more important than who know what when or who fall on his sword or whether someone can use this disaster to make a political point or two Mr Chairman we can forgive Major Colvin who out of his frustration and despair find himself condone something which can not possibly be condone we can do that much but gentleman what we can not forgive what I can not forgive ever be how we you I this administration all of we how we turn away from those street in West Baltimore the poor the sick the swollen underclass of our city trap in the wreckage of neighborhood which be once so prize Communities which we 've fail to defend which we have surrender to the horror of the drug trade and if this disaster demand anything of we as a city it demand that we say enough enough to the despair which make policeman even think about surrender enough to the fact that these neighborhood be not save or be beyond the saving enough to this administration 's indecisiveness and lethargy to the garbage which go uncollected the lot and row house which stay vacant the addict who go untreated the work man and woman who every day be deny a chance at economic freedom enough to the crime which every day choke more and more of the life from our city and the thing of it be if we do not take responsibility and step up not just for the mistake and the miscue but for whether or not we be go to win this battle for our street if that do not happen we be go to lose these neighborhood and ultimately this city forever if we do not have the courage and the conviction to fight this war they way it should be fight the way it need to be fight use every weapon that we can possibly muster if that do not happen well then we be stare at defeat and that defeat should not and can not and will not be forgive it be a good case I be not deny that but I need to trust my people unless you can give your word there be no way that be more than fair thank but it be
