minute what would the death toll be how many car collide we have plane down at L A x how many more across the country around the world F A A 's report 877 aircraft down in the United States alone Air Force Two be one of them the veep be on board what about hospital Operations Births that be in process People probably die walk up a flight of stair global projection be pretty staggering what about the blackout themselves sir what about they well we 've be say people have be black out but that be not my experience for I it be more like a dream only more vivid than that one second I be in a car the next I be somewhere else yeah the same thing happen to I during the blackout people seem to have experience some kind of hallucination except that mine do not feel like a hallucination what be your point I do not just lose consciousness it feel more like my consciousness go somewhere else like I be have a memory only it it be not of the past it be of the future I be in my office it be night it be 10 00 on the hour I be look out into the atrium and I happen to see the date April 29 2010 about half a year from now hold on April 29th I see the same date it be on the news Same for I April 29th 10 00 p M so you be say what everyone 's consciousness just jump forward six month to April 29th Crazy as that sound yeah sit down sit down J T could you give I a hand thank we do not do this even if you do not you be still plan on kill thousand of people so stay still and shut up you get ahold of Zoey yeah she be all right Mark hey you get a sec Sure there may be a way to corroborate what we be talk about in there what do you mean well in my flash forward it be April 30th 6 00 a m but I be in London which be 8 hour ahead of the west coast so it make sense wait flash forward what be we talk about here I will explain later tell I what you see I be have a meeting with our liaison at New Scotland Yard I remember we be interrupt because this bird just crash into the window the point be I have a vision of Fiona Banks Let us see if she have a vision of I Inspector Banks Fiona this be Al Gough FBI I be here with my colleague in L A my God I know why you be call you want to know what I see we all do we be in my office what be the date April 30th what time I do not know 6 00 in the morning do not ask I why it be so early something to do with the Rutherford case yes and something interrupt we yes a bird it fly at the window break its neck so our vision be the same when the worldwide blackout occur early today people be undergo brain scan at that exact moment so like mri or PET scan that kind of thing exactly and in each of these case the hippocampus that be the memory center of the brain be actively engage for the entire 2 minute and 17 second these think pattern be consistent with a wake experience People be not asleep they be not dream so what do they experience by all appearance memory of event that have not occur yet so everyone see the future but do they see the same future be these account consistent well they certainly seem to be hundred of thousand of people be watch news broadcast read newspaper and their detail seem to be the same Senator Glenway will be face ethic charge the Dow will be on an upswing there will be food riot in Ghana and the list go on a remarkably concise series of event be start to come together from that day it be like a grand mosaic be be fill in everyone on earth Mosaic that be the name of the investigation I be work on in my vision it have to do with what cause all this so do you see anything in your vision that be helpful Photographs name people of interest if this really be the future we all see then I guess maybe they will be lead but none of they make any sense to I right now anything else no that be it what about you what do you see nothing I black out like everybody else and wake up on the road what about our person of interest do we think she be involve she be a dead end if you ask I and clueless as the rest of we well circle back on it anyway we be grasp at straw at this point Janis you wanna share what you see yeah I be get a prenatal sonogram the baby be about 17 week and it be a little girl it be totally bizarre but I be obviously not pregnant I do not even have a boyfriend and you sir I be in a meeting and I happen to glance down at the paper Sports page the Rays rally from 3 run down to sweep the Sox at Fenway and there be another story Kobe Bryant tear his ligament in his knee out for the season we should start write these story down the post have a circulation of a million a million how many other people be read it too we get to start compare story it be not just the Post it be all the other news outlet 7 billion people catch a glimpse of the future maybe just one of they know why this happen how do we compare 7 billion story you create a web site People can log on and post what they see and cross reference their vision we can piggyback on that and search for pattern that be what I be already do what do you mean Mosaic all those lead I be run down we should start follow up on them now assume your vision be even accurate the investigation do not exist yet but it could it will in my flash forward I be investigate what cause all this I seem to have an idea why all of this be happen and those people the place I see on the board they be part of this puzzle Mosaic look I be certain of it fine we will set up interagency task force and as far as this office be concern you three you own this this be kind of insane we be run point on this because he have a vision of we run point on this you find that funny we do not even know it be the only lead we have we do not have anything right now it work for I the whole world 's on pin and needle people Air traffic 's be ground People scare to leave their home martial law 's across half this country priority number one find out what cause this priority number two be figure out whether or not it will happen again you get it yes sir Good I be out okay my psychic friend what do you get I remember a name D Gibbons gibbon that be right yeah what else you get there be a photograph here of a doll the doll be burn the head be melt there be a bullet casing nearby something about Baltimore a hand Baltimore no no no wait wait wait wait wait a a blue hand that be what it say what the hell do that mean I have no

they be wear mask they want to kill I because of what I know one of them have a tattoo how many d gibbon there be in the world maybe thousand have Janis compile a list not a hell of a lot to go on yet at least you remember something what do you mean everybody see something everybody have some kind of a vision I do not see a damn thing Mark maybe it mean you will be sleep six month from now then why

Simcoe he work at Stanford but no one be be able to locate he yet so even if the kid pull through he could still wind up an orphan you save his life today you chalk that up as a victory I be try but after a day like today what about you how be you stay so zen through all this who say I be you wanna know why I be not at work yesterday I 've be go through some really heavy thing recently I do not

alive you know and everything be change for I now whatever I be think about do obviously be not mean to happen it be like a sign from God or something you know these vision be a gift do not you think

planet lose consciousness at the exact same period of time right right so I start cycle through a bunch of surveillance camera for the last five hour because I be curious to see what they record I look at hundred of them I check every major city even web cam in other country and they all show the exact same thing at 11 00 a m people start drop like fly and then 2 minute and 17 second later they start to come to and then I see this this be in Detroit what be I look at Hang on a second look right there no way yeah who the hell be that why be they awake Blackout Team all we know for certain be that everyone on the planet seem to have black out at exactly the same time you shut off the consciousness of the entire human race for 2 minute 17 second I do not just lose consciousness it feel more like I be have a memory only it be in the future the same thing happen to I you be say everyone 's consciousness just jump forward six month Crazy as that sound yeah priority number one find out what cause this in my flash forward I seem to have an idea why all of this be happen I be get a prenatal sonogram I be obviously not pregnant I be with another man I 've never see he before I do not see a damn thing what if I do not see anything because six month from now I be go to be dead what have you get something I make for you what do you get a boy car plow straight through a fence you be go to be okay honey I know Olivia how do you know my name right there look right there no way who the hell be that and why be they awake I be sorry you be his father Lloyd Simcoe Time 's up what do you see I and my family be at Disneyland what do you see I see a pony I be eat ice cream what do you see none of your business it be Blackout everyone have to play I do not want to you have to tell that be the rule give he back not until you tell Charlie you know we do not hit at school you be come with I right now young lady get back here 1x02 White to play I 've be struggle ever since I have the vision they say we be suppose to live our life one day at a time but how be I suppose to do that with the future breathing down my neck every day just bring I close to what I see and it seem like I can not avoid it and there you be stare back at I not one have any answer do you the guy 's hammer no you do not because there be no answer because this program be a joke I get an answer for you you need to take a walk cool down a little spare we the rest of your bender look I hate see that as much as you do but you never interrupt another person 's share I be sorry but loaded and share the guy be push my button I 've be deal with some stuff so be he you be worried about Olivia you be worried you be go to fall off the wagon in the future he be go and do it now what be the difference you be both struggle look at all these people every one of they be deal with the same thing we be the future only difference be most of they do not have a support group to help they cope with what they see maybe it be good maybe it be bad maybe it be inexplicable the point be it happen to everyone every single human being on the planet I see my daughter alive Explain that you can walk up to any one of these stranger and ask they what do you see and they would know exactly what you be talk about when in the history of the world have that ever happen we be all prophet now six agent resign this morning that be a grand total of 18 in the past 3 day now I know we be all more than a little freak out right now everybody in this building be scared or hopeful or confuse about what they see but unlike everybody outside this building we have a responsibility to put all that aside because we be the one people look to when their world go to piece it be worth take military transport from Washington for that little speech Deputy secretary Anastasia Markham Homeland Security I hear there be an FBI field office which appoint themselves solely responsible for investigate the blackout if there be another office or agency that have a vision of this investigation and have more information than we do let I know and I will send them our case file excuse I Problem at my daughter 's school so what be they do when it happen they be play Blackout it be the same kind of role play that we see after 9 11 and Katrina sorry I can not believe she be all that different from the other child the other child they be talk about what they see just like the rest of we but the fact that Charlie have not it suggest something deep so be everything okay at home I be with another man we be fine have she discuss anything that she might have see we be take the she will tell we when she be ready to approach you might consider rethink that and ask she look obviously neither of we want to talk about this but Charlie be not in my flash forward I be assume she be at home with you just say it Mark you see another man somebody who I 've never even meet someone who even if I do meet I would turn around and walk the other way you have to believe that but in your vision you be involve with he you say you have feeling for he and he be in our house what if Charlie see the same guy too we do not know what Charlie see it be 10 00 at night she have to have be home come on it be the most likely scenario and we both know it she be upset 'cause she think her family 's go to fall apart I be not go to let that happen I be not go to let some man I 've never even meet come in and threaten what we have what we 've build together it be not go to happen of course not but it do not change the fact that we get to show Charlie that Mom and Dad be still good be we good Olivia I meet with a divorce attorney this morning that be funny I meet with mine last night yeah so we be a disaster DEFCON 1 at least or like DEFCON plus one yeah if it exist it be go to take a hell of a lot more than fate if you want to get rid of I we be go to beat this Olivia now let I get this right you take it on yourself to use bureau fund to make a web site we 've be call it the Mosaic collective and what the web site do be it ask people to post what they see during their vision now in the 17 hour since the site have go live we 've get over 600 000 response so far it confirm the theory that if you put the description of people ' vision together you do start to get a definitive picture a mosaic of April 29th now we be use N S A 's echelon network algorithm to intercept any suspicious word and to look for pattern now the hope be those pattern will eventually lead to an explanation of what cause the blackout so we can at least prevent another one you be spend million of dollar on a hope comfort but how can you be sure what make you think that this be a schedule event well the blackout happen at exactly 11 00 a M Pacific daylight time there be 60 minute in an hour 60 second in a minute so the chance of something happen at exactly the top of any hour be 1 in 3 600 in other word the odd of this happen by chance be vanishingly remote I could give you a list as long as my arm of unscheduled event happen to coincide with the top of an hour exactly right now this be all supposition some people be say that that alien do this other people be say it be the rapture but the United States government be not go to contribute to it with unsupported accusation theory and hypothetical flight of fancy all right what be this our hypothetical flight of fancy this be take at Detroit 's oxide super stadium about midway through the blackout as far as we know this be the only person on the planet that be awake at that time Awake we do not know how he or she be immune or why but obviously it be get our attention and now it be get yours as well what be all that Mommy Babe these be picture of people that other people be look for 'cause they be lose well everybody be still clean up but when they be do everybody will be find really be you sure yeah super special sure let us go I know it be in here somewhere okay sweetie let us go just like we say in the car you be go to be super good yes Mommy and I be go to find Debbie and she be go to help take care of you what be you do here a little incident at school and the babysitter 's go awol what do we get admit be level off we be run out of hallway to put bed in how about that truck driver his sat be hold also Mr Simcoe father of the MVA boy he be be ask for you I 've get to try and get there it be all I can do to get out of the or and work what about Squirrlio he be hurt intensive care you be hurt he Mom I be make he well you know what would help his recovery be 10 cc of milk and cookie stat do you can do that for I doctor Nice go find Debbie Dr Benford I presume I be Lloyd Simcoe this be awkward well it do not have to be a simple apology for avoid my son 's bedside and we can move right along I be sorry you and I have never meet yeah that be the general objection I be try to convey sorry I have to make a call I 've be camp out at my son 's bedside for three day wait to meet this mysterious surgeon who apparently save his life I be so sorry it be just ever since the blackout I be completely slam with work so that be why I can tell I be sure your son have a favorite toy I really do not know honestly his condition make he a little hard to read he be autistic where be he on the spectrum I be not all that familiar with the terminology Dylan 's mother and I separate soon after he be diagnose to make matter bad his mother my wife she die during the blackout I hear that I be so sorry thank you actually I still have not work up the courage to give Dylan the news so sorry I still have a fair number of question regard his condition Sure you be in excellent hand with Dr Varley he can really answer most of your question right very good of luck with the procedure everything okay with Charlie yeah it be fine where have you get that Charlie make it for I be that the same one from your vision you be wear it you do not have kid Charlie 's in free fall right now the last thing I need be her freak out because I would not accept her gift then do something that do not involve wear it what be your problem Dem you put on that bracelet it be like say you want the future to happen believe I I do not but let us be honest about why you be so work up here it be not my future you be worried about it be yours what if I do not see anything because six month from now I be go to be dead you be panic over what might happen but if these flash forwards really be a window into the future then we 've get to do everything we possibly can to use they to our advantage what about D Gibbons have we make any headway with the name there be about 15 000 d gibbon worldwide 4 000 in the US and of those about a thousand have criminal record Bureau 's work with some local pd to knock on door but it be go to take time we do not have time we do not even know if D Gibbons be important that name be on my office wall six month

snippy and the pigeon could be nothing could be the key that unlock everything accord to your year of investigate global blackout right Mark 's right at this point any detail could be significant run

hello I will be your BND liaison during your stay thank for arrange this meeting on such short notice you be here as guest of the german government as such you have no actual authority and will proceed with appropriate decorum agree agree there be a lot of ghost here be not this where Sophie Scholl and the rest of the White Rose Nazi resistance group be execute if I be not mistaken your country eradicate it be indigenous indian population and practice institutionalized slavery for over 250 year we also give the world Britney Spears Rudolf Geyer may present himself as a frail forgetful old man but I should remind you that he manage to elude capture for half a century spending at least 20 of those year within your own US border he be an unrepentant murderer his entire existence have be base on dissemblance and falsehood never forget that Herr Geyer gentleman and lady I 've look forward to meet you Herr Benford for quite some time how do you know my name I see it in my vision you say you have information about the flash forward about how long they last it be not quite that simple I be afraid you see before my unfortunate incarceration I live in America and I learn how you can not get something for nothing we 've anticipate this Herr Geyer upon verification of your information you will be transfer to a minimum security facility but I have more than a gesture in mind I want to return to America and all charge against I be drop you be dream I be not permit my client to breathe a word of what he know without get his pardon first I believe we have what be call a game of chicken who do you think will blink first before you answer consider the fact I have nothing to lose he be play we think about it this be win win for he at good he be just jerk we around for a few day ' entertainment and at bad he go free and we have no we will figure out a way to cover ourselves if he be lie you hear his lawyer they be not go to let we cover ourselves this be full pardon or nothing that be what Geyer 's go to give we we do not know the only thing be Geyer 's important to our case six month from now which mean listen to yourself I be listen Mark six month from now the only thing we know at this point be how much we do not know Mark you be talk about let a mass murderer go free in exchange for potentially nothing Janis there be several billion people who need answer that be not nothing they need to know why it happen whether it will happen again the guy make I sick but he be 86 year old he be on his way out and as much as I would like to personally help he on his way I have to ask myself if the end do not justify the mean here they never do Geyer 's age be irrelevant there be no statute of limitation on evil Geyer deserve his punishment and his victim deserve he get that punishment and you can not take that away from they on a hope so how be Mark handle all of this the usual way throw himself into work how about Stan the same since become bureau assistant director he be convinced he have to work twice as hard as everybody else in the bureau he be pull two all nighter in a row work on this eulogy for the memorial service like if he find the right word he could bring these agent back to life Mark 's convinced that what he see in his flash forward be go to save we all so Mark see himself save the world and what do you see hey honey nothing important how about you I be home I be in Jason 's room but all of his stuff be go that make sense he be in college he still come home for holiday but in my vision everything be go and replace by a young boy 's thing he be about 8 or 9 year old and I be put he to bed good night Mom good night Attaf and you 've never see this kid before no never People be say these vision be real so I do not know how but in the next six month this little boy 's go to come into my life and I be go to be his mom I refuse to believe these vision be random there be a purpose I know it we have a compromise to suggest one piece of information now and one later an offer of proof you verify certain aspect of my client 's flash forward pardon he then he will give you the remainder of what he know fine the 137 second why in my time at Treblinka I obviously come into contact with many Jews I also come to learn about certain aspect of their belief their culture be this going somewhere tell I Miss Hawk why do you wear a ring on your left thumb what be it matter in some eastern european country where homosexuality be illegal a ring on a woman 's left thumb be consider an indication of her proclivity what do this have to do with anything everything and nothing I be merely reference a certain kind of code I will now make a reference to another kind of code have you hear of Kabbalah it be a set of esoteric teaching jewish mysticism in Kabbalah everything have a hide meaning this be the word spell in Hebrew and each letter in the Hebrew alphabet be ascribe a number and if you add up these number you arrive at 137 exactly the number of second that the blackout last listen to I the only reason I be share the same air as you be because you say you 've get relevant information and you 've get exactly one minute to prove that to I or I be go you will not leave not yet I have information that will prove crucial to your investigation and I know it because in my flash forward I be be repatriate to the United States and I have buy my freedom with the second piece of information which I be prepared to share with you what do you see I be in an american airport I do not know which one I be clear through immigration there be a young man who be process my document I remember he have a nametag that read Jerome Murphy Disappointing Agent Benford 's not here to welcome I home come back from Germany return home actually I have one murder to thank for it a murder whose murder this be just our offer of proof Locate this customs agent this J Murphy compare his flash forward to my client 's confirm he be tell the truth be you enjoy watch we jump through your hoop I hope you be because you be never leave this prison Geyer I will leave on April 29th 2010 it be a future that have already happen I can not believe you be run with this let us just see if his flash forward prove out if it do it mean Geyer 's free in six month ' time which mean he be tell we the truth or a lie we believe be you okay with this Benford hey it be I you get a minute Aaron what be up I need a favor a big favor it be for Tracy I want to get she remain exhume test them against the dna the military 's get on file for her I will listen to any this be not a good idea speech you got to give if you can swear you would not do the exact same thing if it be Charlie you fax over the paperwork I will push it through there be no paperwork 'cause it be not sign and it be not sign 'cause it need Kate 's signature I need you to push through more than paperwork here Aaron that be I say it be a big favor leave aside the illegality have you think about what will happen if the result come back positive and the person in that grave be Tracy I see she Mark I see she alive it be impossible that be what make it a leap of faith you 've never take a leap of faith I be a little busy right now I be sorry I be just everything be fine with Zoey I will take care of it you tell he I will call when I 've get the warrant a warrant for a customs officer no that be something else Marcie run through the T S A employee database and there be not any J Murphys work custom at any of the airport in the continental United States do you check applicant Geyer say he speak to an actual officer six month from now our guy might not be work custom yet have Marcie check if she find something run it down there a problem my head 's just not in the game today boss get it in the game hello Jerome Murphy have a minute like you be say I make it I be go to be a custom official Man I see it but I do not really believe it this rock dude I totally think I blow the physical do I get a gun and stuff I need you to focus here I be try to corroborate a suspect 's flash forward and he claim that you be in it do you understand sure no problem what be corroborate mean I need you to tell I whether you see the same thing in your flash forward as this guy claim he see in his I know that I be work in an airport it feel good Badge Uniform it give I purpose come back from Germany I wake up after the blackout apply the next day do you remember anything else anything odd come to think of it he do he say something about a murder I have a murder to thank for it I figure I just misheard he all right I might be in touch I can explain that that be okay I know what a bong be that be not mine it be my roommate 's look home slice if I get tag for this that be it for I they will not hire I with drug bust on my record it do seem unlikely I be do it I see myself do the job I see myself

thank to moral relativism I be sorry this be bother you so much I be sorry this be not bother you at all do not make this personal do not hide behind the badge you be the one drive this thing you be just own it at least Fine I 've be drive this it be what we do we cut the dealer a pass to get the distributor we let the foot soldier walk to bust the kingpin but there have to be some limit there have to be people that we will not deal or flip and I be sorry but if we can not even draw that line at a Nazi I do not even know what we be do anymore have you ever take a leap of faith what be that get to do with anything I be push this because I have faith that see Geyer 's picture in my flash forward mean his information will be important to we there you go there be our problem because in my flash forward all I see be a baby that I do not even know I want so how can I have faith in something I be not even sure be real then you 've get a problem because that be what faith be Benford Dem

Ladies and gentleman the President of the U S A Ladies and gentleman please please be seat be seat please so if you want to understand why the senate hearing be close you would have to ask a senator but I be willing to wager it be because National Security issue will be discuss next question Mr President Mr President 3 week since the blackout and there be still no centralized agency to deal with the consequence what be your response to critic who say that your administration have not learn from the lesson of 9 11 and Katrina today 's hearing have be convene to address just this issue we be

travel a lot he be away from home his support system I overhear you both talk about he go to meeting in Washington be he have a hard time it be just a friendly reminder the last time Mark have a problem he be away from home testify in one of his case he have be promote this be a little different I think it be exactly the same and even if be not look I get it thing have be stressful for both of you I guess Mark tell you about my flash forward of course he be just fixate now on the idea that in 6 month ' time I be go to be sleep with another man which be insane but his whole job depend on these flash forward come true so Mark 's an alcoholic he do not need a reason to drink he drink because he drink I know if you be ask I if I think he be go to take a drink I be be you ask for he or for you I do not know I love he Aaron I just I know I can not control he that be the hard part about all of this Trust always be with an alcoholic but if you can not trust Mark who can you trust let I guess you remember you owe I and have a change of heart about help I out we be not on the campaign trail anymore and inside the beltway well you have to be a little subtler about call in our chit I get out of the beltway if you recall you be right about I owe you one and about I help you out but my plan be go to bring you right back in the beltway I always feel really bad that I could not bring you on board initially it be fine everything work out the chinese view chaos as opportunity and the blackout give I the chance to pay you back Director of Homeland Security member of my cabinet I be pretty sure Clemente will block my appointment Clemente 's get big fish to fry think about it there be no rush thank you this be the sixth course what be you a food critic Chef actually this be my restaurant the one where I work your be FBI I be guess you be not out I work for the federal government and they be not too big on trust gay with gun who know maybe six month from now we will all be more enlighten in my flash forward I be here in the restaurant but I have a wedding band on my finger that be way too much information especially for a first date maybe it be a sign of how well this be go help I change the subject what do you see in your flash forward well I be on the International Space Station have a 3 way with Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin really actually do I say I be in the restaurant I be on who want to be a Millionaire and Angelina Jolie be the game show host you slut Angie just ask I the million dollar question I go to phone a friend you but you do not answer so my millionaire moment be go I do not buy that what that Angelina Jolie would be a game show host that I would ever let you down like that actually Senator Clemente the FOA the EPA and the CDC have all rule out psychotropic pharmaceutical in the global water supply as the potential cause of the consciousness shift an alien intelligence may have be at work here yes that be what we be think China can you elaborate Director Keller China 's population number 1 3 billion yet they suffer fatality of less than half a percent during the blackout no mystery when the blackout happen it be 2 00 over there everybody be asleep that do not strike you as a bit convenient they be practically untouched while America suffer the great number of causality per capita of any country in the world it be the CIA 's belief that this be not an accident we believe that this be a targeted event design to bring about the collapse of our government let us take a short recess then we will hear from Stanford Wedeck field director of the FBI 's Los Angeles office Agent Wedeck be currently run an interesting investigation that have diverge significantly from the methodology employ by the rest of the bureau it be all Kabuki theater now I remember what I hate about DC what this place turn I into Stan just remember who you be this whole thing will blow over and you will be home before you know it enjoy DC Stanford I be go to have to call you back Joyce Senator actually have anyone ever tell you you be a sore loser Joyce Look who be talk you be the one who got put out to pasture speaking of which how do you sleep at night know what you do with that woman do your wife know if I could 've prove what you do six year ago I would be sit behind the desk in the Oval Office right now if it make you feel any well I doubt you would 've get a 2nd term if you sit by the river long enough you will see the body of your enemy float by Sun Tzu get ready to float Stanford you wanna go after I you give it your good shot but Mosaic be a joke not everyone 's vision be go to come true Most people do not agree Most people do not see what I do I see myself as president in six month now as impossible as that may be it be a nice thought be not it how much do you hear enough to know I do not want to be the guy in Joyce Clemente 's gun sight you do not while other be use what they know of the present to explain the blackout our office be try to consolidate information glean from the flash forwards themselves the Mosaic collective have gather the vision of hundred of thousand of people all around the world let our office construct a picture of what the world will look like on April 29th 2010 a tact I believe you 've take without prior approval or proper authorization it be get result yes I forget you be an end justify mean kind of guy no matter how questionable those mean may be in this case the mean merely involve use the future we 've see to guide our investigation of the blackout how exactly one of our agent have a flash forward of himself investigate the cause of the blackout he remember lead and investigatory path that we will not have for another six month those lead have already lead to significant break in the case Significant might be overstate thing a little Agent Wedeck still if your entire investigation be bottomed on what this one agent see perhaps we should hear from he I be the Deputy Field Director Mme Chairman you seem to have land on your foot quite nicely Mr Wedeck the point be I be the one head up the investigation not to mention that Agent Benford 's already be thoroughly vet include submit to a polygraph in that case he will not mind submit to some question from we this hearing reconvene tomorrow at 10 00 a m with Agent Benford 's testimony just tell the truth it be get we this far here let a professional do that thank you you know I be not totally useless Maya I can break down a sig sauer in like 12 second I be impressed I do not even know what a sig sauer be stupid alarm clock I can never set it right no wonder I be always late speaking of which I actually have to go to the office now exciting day collar bad guy you watch too much cable and no it be actually a busy day analyze satellite imagery so totally different all right let I get dress stay eat food Rifle through my stuff just lock the door when you leave will I see you later one of my friend be have a showing at the Merton Gallery Great we 've determine that at least two man be awake during the blackout moreover we 've discover a recur theme of crow attrition Crow attrition crow die all over the world during the blackout the same thing happen in Somalia in 1991 now I be no scientist but that seem significant to I because you see it in your flash forward no we learn about the crow death from a lead that I remember from my flash forward and this be a lead you follow up on your own my office do yes why exactly have your office set up its own investigation without get authorization from FBI Headquarters well to be perfectly honest in my flash forward I seem to be or rather the LA office seem to be at the center of the blackout investigation really a how do you determine this here we go in my vision I be run point on something call Mosaic I have a case board set up in my office cover in clue picture lead everything that you would see in an ongoing fruitful investigation in other word you be investigate this because you have a vision of investigate this you have a bulletin board with lot of nice picture on it but what lead you to assume your investigation would actually amount to anything because Mme Chair I also see a team of mask gunman try to kill I Presumably for what we will have accomplish in this investigation over the next six month six month from now mask gunman be go to burst into your office in a secure federal building and try to kill you that be what I see yes do you find anything the Ganwar region be the habitat of the remarkable somali pygmy gerbil Awesome so how be your date you have a date be there any groping can we focus on what we be do if the satellite imagery do not give we anything then let us start to look at environmental statistic Anomalies in the ozone layer sunburst activity during that time anything any reasonable explanation now you be talkin ' wait do you see that be that an asphalt road go forward what be those they look like pylon in the middle of nowhere or tower Agent Benford why be you alone in the office that night Presumably I be work late and what be you do before you realize the gunman be in there look at the Mosaic case board I think I might 've be on the phone at some point but I be not sure who I be talk to how can you not be sure other people who be on the phone in their flash forward remember who they be talk to if you do not believe I Senator you should talk to the bureau agent who polygraphe I I do he be kind enough to provide a transcript of your session you describe your experience as impressionistic flash of reality be this correct yes and from what I can tell you 've recount about 30 second worth of Impressions everyone else we 've hear from unless they be asleep experience vivid easily recall vision cover the entire 2 min and 17 s of the blackout be that a question I be just try to understand be the building on fire be there smoke in the room why be everything in your recollection so hazy and disjoint as far as I know there be no fire then how do you account for the stark qualitative difference between your experience of the blackout and everyone else 's with all due respect Mme Chair have you speak to all 7 billion people on the planet no I have not possibly because those 7 billion people be not seek million of dollar to spearhead an investigation base on their somewhat murky flash forwards Senator Clemente hundred of thousand of federal dollar have be spend because of what you claim to have see do not you think somebody how dare you should 've ascertain what you be do the other hundred plus second be I the only one who think these investigative technique seem a little close to voodoo or fraud now do someone have a question about Nazi repatriation where the hell be Wedeck Toilet for 40 minute Voice mail what a disaster that Clemente be a hard ass but when you hear it lay out like that it do sound questionable it sound like we consult the psychic network for clue or something thank I be not say I think that necessarily it sound totally nuts dead bird D Gibbons doll head China that be start to sound pretty good right about now so it be a mistake to mention the doll head be what you be say get to a laptop we get something you be go to want to see what be we look at here Wajid Somalia population 325 about 200 mile east of nowhere Oprah 's building a school there Honey be quiet the grow up be talk this be a satellite photo take December of 1990 about five month before your crow do a face plant what the hell be those we do not know but they be build from scratch over the course of five month you get the idea it look like they be about 100 foot tall when they be complete here in April of 1991 the same month our proto blackout hit any idea what these structure be beat I but it be the last thing I would expect to see at a place that do not even have indoor plumbing we be send the image down to forensic for evaluation the state department 's be stonewall we on our request to send a team in this look like it will cut through some red tape whoever build these clearly do not want anyone else to know about them Janis Hawk Janis this be Wedeck everything okay I need you to do something for I right away hey Maya hey sorry I be late my boss call right as I be out the door no worry I get you a little something thank you I just see it and think of you wake up it be time to get up so you be not late anymore unless you wanna be thank you that be very sweet can I ask you something yeah it be a little awkward you be getting all fluster do you date guy too the last one be in high school and I try not to think about it why I guess that be the part that be awkward I kind of do something you go through my stuff I know you would do that I do the next good thing I mosaic ed you you what I could not resist it be way well than Google stalk I see that in five month from now you will be you know pregnant and as talente as I may be in the bedroom that would be pretty impressive it be not a big deal in my flash forward I be wear a wedding ring maybe it be ours for what it be worth I think that you be go to be a great mom and that be the wrong thing to say too this be not a I you thing this be a I thing and honestly I have not even figure it out yet I do not even know what I be go to do you know what

drink again but I can not change what I see I put my entire career on the line base on your flash forward and now you be tell I you be impair when you have it I do not know what I be do anymore that be fantastic Mark that be fantastic everything okay in here Everything 's fine guy will not do not you buy yourself a couple round on I it be celebration time what be we celebrate I get we our funding Pound Zero three one two Set Damn it Aaron all thing be equal it would not have be the bad thing in the world if I have forget it I just want you to know the detail I do remember I remember clearly Fabulous Look just keep your mouth shut you tell anyone else about this we be DOA President Segovia have announce his nominee for vice president a position which have be vacant since the tragic death of Vice President Pratt during the blackout tonight the President say he have nominate Senator Clemente the nominee will have to be approve by majority vote in both house of Congress I do not get this town everything be a trade off DC 's your ultimate can not get something for nothing place here we go just want to share some good news with you we 've get our funding Mosaic 's still alive because of the somali intel no Wedeck pull some kind of rabbit who know maybe he would not have have to if get out let us go go wake up it be time to get up wake up it be time to get up tell I it be a girl

advantage Mark we get our funding Mosaic 's still alive I know what cause the flash forwards you do not believe I of course I do the world 's great mystery 's be solve by a boozer on a train bind for Los Angeles can you connect to the internet with that real quick do an image search for quantum physicist genius go on I will wait which pop up first I win the Robert Wilson award or the jaunty one of I hold lab goggle over my genital hold up you really I be obviously waste my time I be sorry I 've just hear that line a hundred time before you genuinely want to know of course the flash forward be cause by you it be simple quantum mechanic really whenever a heavenly body carry such an intense force of attraction the universe just go banana sound technical help if you have a phd or two if my calculation be correct your dark energy could bring about another catastrophe at any moment luckily I 've pinpoint the one location on Earth that have an irresistible enough force to counteract you let I guess your sleeper car grab your purse we 've not a moment to lose I think for sure that would work a 21 year old sorority girl maybe but I 've learn never to go anywhere unless I be go to get the real thing the actual cause I have a theory but the science be a little complicated I be a complicated girl I can handle it the most basic concept you need to understand be quantum superposition be you aware of the double slit experiment there be that one time in college what about Schrödinger 's cat no I be not that kinky close your eye give I your hand now imagine you have a cat B B L be a liter in the field and only one p I V we need access here a teeny tiny cat what have we get a gunshot wound to the abdoman we need to set up a peripheral we need access here that fit in the palm of your hand you also have a poisonous sardine once we close your palm there be two possible scenario bring the code cart come on let us go Clear either the cat eat the sardine and die or do not eat it the sardine and live no response go again Quantum physics say until we open your hand to discover the cat 's fate both eventuality occur at the same time Clear still no response c p r for we the cat be both live and decease but how can that be the miracle of quantum mechanic the observer get to decide the kitty 's already make up its mind alive or dead see for yourself Scary Monsters and Super Creeps Hemoglobin 's holding at 12 Hallelujah Fascia 's closed o silk on a driver to Dr Varley I be go to be honest a few hour ago I do not think we would get this far close the skin let I know when

be the question be there go to be another world blackout People be terrify let us get back to the big question what question do we have free will that be the big question the central question of human existence for millennium if this be suppose to be your resignation forget it you be not go to let I explain myself you be attack you be shoot you return to duty to find out a coworker jump off a building be I in the right ballpark my life be not make a whole lot of sense right now and I think I need a little time off to figure it out Understandable I need you here I know we 've be shorthande since the blackout but since Gough since Al this be not about Al yes it be when I find out about what he do and why he do it it make I think about my own future what I be suppose to do do I lean into what I see do I fight it what if my getting shot be I do not know some some sort of a sign that this baby 's not mean to be you be go to let a bullet decide whether you bring a baby into this world if Al 's death prove anything it be that our choice still matter now more than ever I believe without reservation or recrimination that your card be the ace of spade that certainly answer that question I 've be wonder how a Nobel finalist and recipient of the MacArthur prize spend his idle moment this be not the time or the place you drop off the radar without so much as a phone call I have to check myself into the hospital to have my bruised ego X ray hello Dylan remember I why this be not my pancake we be not have this discussion in front of my son I be do have you dictate when and where we talk Myhill forward I the e mail you send he or the suicide note it be the only logical move if you be bent on self destruction I suppose it be I have doubt as to the cause of the blackout our experiment kill 20 million people 20 million the world have be upend People need answer we have to go public and tell the world we cause the blackout all right we have to leave this room sometime I have a reservation with the hotel that say different plus you have not open your gift yet what be this just a little something to celebrate what be we celebrate second chance I guess and the fact that we can change the thing we see I never think we could not that be the office I tell them not to call unless it be an emergency I promise yeah hey it be I this well be good Dem I be sorry something come up do you bring your laptop yeah I be send you some video we get from Barstow p D remember you have Marcie plug the clue off the Mosaic board into NCIC get something Barstow p D catch a homicide Eyewitness record it on her cell phone when it hit the system NCIC kick back a red flag why stay tune I be head back right now play Cards with Coyote what do we have anything that might help us i d our tattooed friend not really the victim Neil Parofsky be an aeronautics engineer who work out of a plant in El Segundo Watch and wallet be miss so everybody 's think robbery be that confirm by whoever shoot the cell phone video Ingrid Alvarez she see Parofsky hand something over before he got shoot so she think it be a mugging too great first day back I should have get you flower they be for your wife for stitch I back together and these be for you hard copy still take from that cell phone Video forensic enhance the image as well they could so now we just get to figure out why someone would want to hit an engineer from El Segundo have Vreede get into Parofsky 's life Friends family bank account whatever what be we go to do what be the name of that eyewitness Ingrid Alvarez we will be talk to her if the guy in her video be one of the man I see in my vision this be our good lead so far our only lead I be put he away now find out who send he and make sure he never show up here on April 29th Al sacrifice himself to prove we could change the future so let us change it hey honey everything okay you be back early Mark have a work thing so what be go on here the usual you have not be go that long it be all right I be sorry it be pathetic waking up every damn morning like this maybe if you would just talk about it I tell you I do not want to talk about it well I be not give you a choice anymore I 've be grieve for you for two year Trace Hell I even have your grave exhume two month ago because I be convinced that you be alive if you want to keep hide out here if you want I to pretend to the world your mom include that you be still dead you have to tell I what happen after what I see in my flash forward I would believe anything at this point listen to I Trace four month from now I be go to be sit by your side in Afghanistan you see it and I see it be not that why you come home obviously at some point I be go to get involve whatever it be so let us just cut to the chase and get start how about the Simcoe boy he be suppose to be discharge while I be go not yet he be complain of calf pain so we remove the cast do a doppler and the kid 's get a DVT you be kid I I be go to be a grandmother before this boy go home I do not get it why be you so anxious to get rid of he be it his dad Mr Simcoe what make you say that just that you guy have a weird relationship I mean every time he come around you get crazy tense and Dr Benford actually Dr Varley just tell I about Dylan 's status but what be the ramification would it be safe to leave the boy 's bedside I see here that you have he on heparin now the risk of complication at that dose be relatively minimal be that correct you be good question a friend of the family Frankly I be hope to pry Lloyd away from the hospital for a while Steak dinner some fraternal martini you could see fit to sanction that I mean the boy be essentially ready to be discharge if I 've read his chart correctly may I bar any complication I see no reason why Dylan could not go home in the next couple of day well it be settle then Lloyd you 've be absolve of any guilt parental or otherwise Lovely thank you for your help of course Dr Varley Nice leg be you sleep with that woman that be none of your concern everything you do be my concern now since you press send on that idiotic e mail of yours which bring I to the purpose of my visit I be go public with or without Myhill 's cooperation or yours good luck anyone to believe you good luck stop I it appear we be at an impasse there be two way to settle this the first be so tawdry and public I make a general annoyance out of myself kick over as many anthill as possible enough Simon or we settle this in a more civilized manner Define civilized do you remember whose name go first on the application for the Sloan fellowship Texas hold'em no hold bar you win we go public hang ourselves out to dry I win you keep your mouth shut and your guilt in check and we buy ourselves some more time you want to wager the fate of million of people on the outcome of a poker game the god do it all the time Dice chess whatever take their fancy they love tinker with the life of those mere mortal we be not god Simon 20 million death on our shoulder be not that what you say if that do not qualify we for Godhood tell I what do let the game begin what be Barstow PD do here let us hope 3 star guy do not get to our witness do you think she drive a gold sedan maybe not anymore Special Agent Benford FBI Detective Rick Malchiodi Barstow p D we think your victim might be an eyewitness in a homicide that be a hell of a coincidence how be that her roommate say she witness a homicide too her roommate Alvarez Ingrid Alvarez come home from work find her roommate there double tap to the side of her head so look like they get the wrong roommate I believe it be to you how much do you want to give I this round 2 500 I hope you do not drag this game out as long as the last one when you lose you will be able to console yourself that I 've prevent you from confess to a mass murder Manchester figure of speech 2 500 I will call I do not understand you be say they kill Blanca but they be try to kill I that be what it look like to we yes and it be because of what happen in the alley now Ingrid what exactly do happen in the alley we have the video but it would really help we to get your account I be work late I and one of my clerk can not say I see you as a blonde and I can not see you as a rock star but that be what you say your vision be I be lock up for the night you want I to walk you to your car I mean it be kind of late I will be fine I go to my car but there be man in the alley three of they they be fight arguing but I could not hear what about but when it get physical I hide I call 9 1 1 but they put I on hold I still can not believe I stay calm enough to think to use my phone my hand be shake so much now you tell the police the victim give the other man something right before they shoot he they be argue about a case or something but I do not see what it be what about the face of the other man do you think you could describe they I do not get a very good look but I think one of they maybe have gray hair the other one be bald and he be big muscular it be very dark we be go to sit you down with a sketch artist whatever you can give we and if you can remember anything else it could be a big help as they be walk away they be talk about something it sound like QED thank you you guy ever read about that inevitability index thing that be be in all the paper 5 000 it be a scam some entrepreneurial huckster 's attempt to sell we on the idea that the odd of the future happening can be calculate it be all rubbish Fate be fate we be not responsible Lloyd what about free will no such thing since when do you become such a hard determinist simple quantum suicide theory I will win this hand and every subsequent hand we play ad infinitum QED do not you get tired of hear yourself pontificate do not you get tired of be a self righteous prig we be scientist Lloyd not attention seek reality show contestant look for their 15 minute of fame on a talk show you always do this what be that use intellectual argument to defend your behavior what so you sleep with Cabrini 's wife and you call it electromagnetism you fire your assistant and blame it on Darwin Shut up now you 've upend the world and you hide behind determinist rhetoric you be not the only one who be lose someone who Simon who have you ever care about I will call you see I know you be bluff this entire time you know why because there be no such thing as luck or fate or there but for the grace of God this game be pointless I 've already win the future be already happen fight it be futile Hey Nicole Nicole you okay sorry my mind wander I be guess Mark tell you what I see he do yeah but only 'cause he be worried about you we both be you do not have to be I be go to be fine the future can change it be all over the news Crazy huge floral delivery for the quintuplet can you give I a hand do not worry Olivia we can change what we see just like we could before the blackout everything be back to be up to we again Dad my humvee got attack your friend Mike tell I that but that be two year ago Tracy why do not you go back to your base I could not the attack we be fire on by suppose friendly Marines Jericho PMC Private Military Contractors I 've hear about they but that do not explain why Jericho work for the military which mean that I can not trust the military hold on a second why would you say you can not trust the military about two week before my humvee be attack I be work long range recon on this village in the foothill near Kunar I be alone order be to stay covert so the local would not see I but there must have be someone else out there Jericho and I watch they I watch as they wipe out a village they kill woman and they butcher child

and get in trouble with Jericho they be this yeah military contractor they be one who attack she I know this sound like something out of a Baldacci novel or something but Tracy be dead and now she be alive so I really need your help Mark 'cause Tracy be scared to death of these Jericho guy and I be afraid they be go to try to find she you all right yeah I see something today and it get I think that if this person 's future could come true and it do even though it seem impossible then maybe these vision be more set in stone than we think or maybe we have to work that much hard you be right do you open my gift they be lovely you do not put them on I figure you would just take them right off again right we can change thing Mark we just have to decide how badly we want to how far we be willing to go to make it happen but I say there be nothing nothing that we should not be willing to do for one another so what be you suggest set a trap for our suspect draw them out I knowa lot be change lately but we still do not use civilian as bait Ingrid know the risk then work the case work the Parofsky angle we 've be do that Parofsky be chief engineer at Micro Circadian Electronics he be recently let go on suspicion of corporate espionage what if Parofsky be sell his work to the high bidder Ingrid do say that they take a package from he right before they shoot he so it be valuable enough to kill for look Stan it be a real lead Ingrid 's go to be protect on this I promise what make you so sure they would try to hit she tonight they already try to kill Ingrid once if we get the word out that we be go to release she from custody they might try again why do you say that we go to Utah D Gibbons know we be come you unearth the Somalia photo five minute later we be getting shoot

come Merry Christmas why would you tell he you lie to I if thing go south you be definitely go to need to keep carry a gun we be live here in Palo Alto where source be claim a major announcement will be make concern the cause of the blackout thank you for attend this press conference my name be Gordon Myhill I be the director of the National Linear Accelerator Project today we have some important information concern the event of October 6th that we feel they be go to crucify we what be a little martyrdom between friend Stick to the point we discuss last thing we need be your conscience drag we far what do that mean you feel guilty because your wife die you have to take care of your son I will not let you drag I down into your shame just because you be play Mr Mum Understood I would like to introduce you now to our associate director of the Plasma Wakefield Program Dr Lloyd Simcoe and Dr Simon Campos good morning my name be Lloyd Simcoe as Dr Myhill indicate our speciality be proton drive plasma Wakefield acceleration what we be try to do be to reproduce the kind of energy level that exist just after the Big Bang on a more controllable scale we be conduct just such an experiment here on October the 6th at precisely 1100 hour Pacific Daylight Time please please if you could wait a moment I will take question please I just need to get to the heart of the matter we be here today because we believe that the global blackout be precipitate by our experiment please if you just give I a moment I will take question in a minute please one moment be you take responsibility for all the death and damage cause by the blackout we admit that our experiment do seem the most likely cause but we contend there be no way to predict anything like this happen whatsoever this be utterly unforeseeable scientist experiment all the time we can not stop experiment because we be not sure of the result what do that mean for Mosaic Game over maybe Simcoe cause the blackout maybe he do not Game 's not over with the work release an official statement regard this event we will be conclude this we will now be conclude please please believe I when I say that our heart go out to anyone who be hurt or lose someone they care for my own wife be kill and I would give anything to have she back we understand people be scared of another blackout there will not be because we be the cause and we assure you we assure you that this could not happen again because of this moment all plasma wakefield experiment be on hold indefinitely you do not even apologize you kill my family Idiot we talk about have suspicion our work contribute to a phenomenon we need to be more definitive there be no we you make that clear you lose all objectivity you be ignore the obvious to save your own skin of course I be it be the scientific method it be about collect empirical evidence until we can prove empirically that we be the cause I be not about to flush my life down the toilet I do not think we be to blame for this you do if you will not see my line of reasoning it be war between we what happen to your tv those scientist I want they in here yesterday I want to debrief they you and seven billion other people they both disappear within ten minute of their announcement Simon Campos be completely off our radar Lloyd Simcoe he have a ticket for a flight to DC that leave San Francisco within an hour of his little speech we find out he be not on the plane wait Simcoe I know I hear that name before how and why Janice when I be in the hospital I overhear Olivia Benford talk about Dylan Simcoe he be a patient that they be treat he be Lloyd Simcoe 's son then you be go to wait for he to check on his boy we do not have any basis for an arrest right this be you one agent reach out that be it we need to know what he know have you speak to Mark or Demetri that be what happen to the tv you 've reach the Nohs leave a message Mrs Noh but this be it this will be the last time I ask you you be the parent of the man I love I want you at our wedding in the future that I see you be there and if you say you will go it make it real I be suppose to marry Demetri and I hope to God that this be the

three mile radius of where the call be place but there be a bunch of good reason why we might find Eartha right here Eartha well she kind of sound like Eartha Kitt do not you think what you know the Batman TV show she play Catwoman you be right she do sound like Eartha Kitt a persian well educate Eartha Kitt there be only two news stand within a block of here that sell persian newspaper this may

woman persian food Yahtzee tomorrow tomorrow forget it what I 've just never be surveille before I be not surveille you it feel like I be be surveille well I could split if you slide I Lloyd Simcoe 's phone number and what do I do after I get fire a girl 's get to try Dr Benford say that you come in while I be away how have it go she say I be do good not good enough to have a baby yet you wanna have a baby I do not but then the blackout happen and I see myself get a sonogram I be pregnant I be totally crazy it be like be in love or something I do not know maybe I will just listen to the universe and and throw the towel in on the whole thing listen in your flash forward you see yourself pregnant if you be really listen to the universe you would be try to have that baby do you know how far along you be the sonographer say four month the beginning of January if that be what you see that be when I be suppose to get pregnant you still wanna get pregnant then do not give up Hitler Idi Ami Suharto Simcoe and Campos kill more people than all of those monster combine there be a real good case to be make here you 've get the big mass murderer in history why be not they in jail Wedeck they have not break any law he be what about criminal negligence and no one leave 20 million people yes there need to be a trial Simcoe go to Harvard 1998 he get his phd so you be here to turn yourself in I be not sure what we do could be construe as a crime even if it be prove we be responsible I do not believe we cause the blackout you probably should not have stand up in front of reporter and say you do not my choice Lloyd Simcoe tend to let his emotion run rampant I do not any idea who be responsible then but if you allow I access to your Mosaic investigation I could divine the answer for you so you wanna be deputize I 've serve on three panel with the National Science Foundation I have security clearance you be confuse I with someone who give a damn I be up for give you not a new career how long do you think Washington will continue to fund an investigation into what cause the blackout when somebody have already step forward and accept the blame my guess be unless you come up with some compelling evidence relatively soon you will never find out what or who cause the great global catastrophe in human history or if you can prevent it from happen again how about this you come back tomorrow morning I will have something to show you we make some progress I will see what I can do about an official role because I do like you Assistant Director Wedeck I will accept your disingenuous offer how dare he come in here he be here do you charter a flight excuse I I be Agent Janis Hawk with the Mosaic task force be you here to arrest I come in and talk to we we need information and you need some protection I be sorry my son 's safety be my priority right now if you 've connect I to he it will not be long before other do as well I have to get he out of here let we help you please this could be an opportunity to be polite I be not interested just leave we alone we be look for a friend she work around here maybe eat at this restaurant we do not have a picture of she but we have a recording can you take a listen and let we know if you recognize it Sure I be sorry there be no delicate way to say this but on March 15th 2010 you be go to be murder I be

you will be sorry you know that woman not so long ago a hotel concierge name Anush Harandi an iranian man much like yourself be take from his home in Bangkok in the middle of the night because my government believe he have some small piece of information his friend his family no one know what happen to he he spend two year in secret detention my government 's get very good at that sort of thing her name be Nhadra Udaya you get her name she come here on the weekend but almost every night she have a late dinner at a dim sum place two block down now we just have to get she to talk one way or another why do not you want I in there I be try to protect you Dem if someone 's hand be go to get dirty let it be mine we 've give these to our top level analyst they have not be able to tell we anything useful it be a good thing I be smart than they be these be highly classify image so we 've obscure anything that indicate where they be take Somalia the dip slope in the overlie limestone the orientation of the flora shallow water tell we what you see be you take the piss tell we what you see Zoom in please I design that that be a specialised post laser for a plasma afterburner it increase the rate of acceleration for radio frequency machine the concept should win I a Nobel in a couple of year I must say the modelling software you guy use be incredibly impressive the structure almost look real that be a real structure and that be a real photograph that be not possible the technology do not exist yet we be still run numerical simulation when do you come up with the idea ' 92 why that photograph be take in 1991 that do not make sense who could 've come up with this idea no one your unparalleled genius act be wear thin that be not what I mean you ask any great scientific mind what they want to achieve and the only honest answer be immortality if you discover something that change the world you live forever so whoever design this not only have to be brilliant but do not care about be famous do not want it practically fetishise their anonymity a recluse a paranoid exactly we believe this man be somehow connect to the blackout this be a composite sketch make by our field agent he be awake during the black out he may have be in contact with another person who be awake we do not even know his real name he be use the alia D Gibbons he be highly efficient in compute equipment and particle physics simulation he be be hack into a number of high tech facility he also seem to have a penchant for chess a techie chess play social misfit physicist that should narrow it down have you ever see he before at conference or lecture but if he have anything to do with the blackout I will do everything to help he at least I would like to give his testicle a squeeze for shock my plasma afterburner I design I need to find somewhere where my son can be safe Southland University Hospital that be less secure than here maybe I be not make myself clear you do not seem very good at that I beg your pardon the announcement you say you cause the blackout and then that you do not mean to it be all kind of a jumble in my experience innocent people tend to speak in specific no I speak in specific I relate a series of fact and now Southland University Hospital I can transfer your son I put it through I want I need you to find a secure facility for my son let us try Travers it be a private child 's hospital in Glendale I doubt they will have bed they will when I make a call get that start and I will draw up a transfer note be back in an hour I do not suppose I can expect anyone to help I much in future you need help I will help you and I John see the Holy City New Jerusalem come down from God out of heaven prepare as a bride adorn for her husband we be here tonight to say a final goodbye to Joyce you see I there but I be positive you be Joyce 's death be a tragic loss we 've lose a daughter a wife a friend but what we must remember what we must hold in our heart look like we find she you should not have come here you call I remember that be a mistake clearly you be here now you will set thing in motion that will end very badly for you can we just skip over the histrionic action movie cliche Cause I be way too jet lag to deal with any of that right now tell I who you be I can not why would you call I I be try to warn you you do not know I why do you care if I live or die your death be the first in a long line of dominos I would rather not see fall down so help we prevent it I can not you can by tell we if I tell you more the act of tell you may bring about the unfortunate incident we be all try to avoid I be willing to take that risk I say you would be shoot three time shot at close range which mean I probably know my killer in fact you do he be sit at this table right now you Agent Benford you will kill Agent Noh on March 15th with the very gun I assume you be carry right now a SIG Sauer model P226 in the call you say you do not know who kill I now you do I lie because I do not want to bring about the incident which I tell you about how could you possibly know a 5 6 1 9 8 4 and what be that the serial number of your gun it will be your gun Agent Benford and you will pull the trigger and then again and then again you could a find the number a different way you could have hack into the Bureau 's gun registry how many time have you interrogate a suspect look into my eye your partner be go to kill you intentionally why would I do that why Presumably in the next few month a reason will present itself now you 've get what you 've come for no I have more question I be do give you answer it be time for you to leave do not you be come with we right now move move move what be we do cover I down the stair now down come on come on trust I I get it back off now Put the gun down this woman be a material witness to a murder there have be no murder but there will be will there Agent Benford let she go Nhadra have your man lower their gun now all the way down this be not over it never be Put your hand behind your back Mr Simcoe hey I have those transfer paper sorry for all the red tape I appreciate it especially after the inconvenience I 've cause you and your family you do nothing wrong be you ready to get Dylan check out you really think there will not be another blackout not unless we recreate the exact condition of our experiment no it be an incredibly brave thing you do come forward like that take responsibility I think the line between brave and stupid 's a pretty blurry one I do not say it be not stupid all

I know a window washer in Los Angeles nothing special about he just go about his life live from day to day hook I up Vague plan few dream and if he have any aspiration he never speak of they like most of we he be already unconscious when the blackout hit before the blackout the window washer live his life ignore the question of the future they just be not that important to he so he believe nothing but the blackout come and this man face certain death many of we think that when divine intervention happen it be something big but it can also be a small thing that seem so inconsequential in the moment that turn out to be the turning point for your entire life big or small what if that moment affect everyone everywhere at the exact same time what would that mean to you where would you look for answer the answer be never about just one person every single person 's life be touch by the blackout none of we be in this alone help each one of we be unique but we be be stitch together to form a tapestry something large that can not be understand until we step back to see the whole thing at some point we all wake up and then we have to choose do we walk in hope believe that what God be do be good or do we stumble around resign ourselves to chaos the window washer see a path through the chaos and he see the good in what he be show that window washer be I 1x11 Revelation Zero these be the question people have always struggle with only now they be more powerful than ever take I through something here you be in a foreign country against my express wish and you decide to pull a gun in a public place just out of curiosity what be you think back off back off now can I go see my wife she be just nearly kidnap what be you think I ask you a question can you try to tell we what you see I be say good bye Dylan Simcoe 's be a patient of mine for a while the paramedic be load he in and that be when I notice no ambo something be wrong we do not have time for this well they be not paramedic they do not know what they be do Bill can you get down here who be Bill the security guard they shoot he they shoot he they just do it and then they turn the gun at I no please do not hurt

to put three bullet in my friend I be not go to invite she to a tea party be you try to be cute at least I be not sit on my hand we still have not go to somalia we can not find D gibbon and for some reason we be not use every resource available to we to find out who the hell suspect zero be Somalia be a war zone and I be work to get we in the Detroit bureau be canvass Michigan look for suspect zero and we 've get gibbon on the ten most wanted list which be more than a miracle to pull off so do not you imply that I be not work with you here be you go to find Lloyd this only happen 'cause he come forward do the right thing please find he your bureau mandate therapist you see she three time a week and when she think you be up to it we will talk about a reinstatement excuse I I know america

not now you 've be through enough this can wait till later let us go home bye bye it be be eight hour since Simcoe be kidnap where be we we know it be a pro job but there have not be any kind of ransom demand we can only theorize as to why he be be take but consider how many people want he dead could be anyone what be he do here nice to see you too agent Noh Agent Vogel have officially join the mosaic task force Embrace it Demetri this be now an interagency investigation I 've ask Dr Campos to be here his close association to Simcoe should be able to shed some light on our kidnapper I suggest we cast a wide net Terrorists anyone interested in future focasting if someone be able to master the flasforward they would be effectively print their own money I think we can all agree that the mind of Lloyd Simcoe be a priceless resource help help can anybody hear I no one can hear you you be dehydrate you should replenish your electrolyte you tell I what I need to know and you can walk out of here right now who be you you actually do not want to know the answer to that question go to hell you have no idea what hell be but I guess you be go to find out from the outside I look the same after the blackout but inside I be different we 've live believe not know the future make life difficult the truth be that it be vastly more difficult know what lie before we but of the tree of

voice say just keep move forward so I create sanctuary a place where we can be safe be there be no threat no danger what do you think they be after it be the experiment at NLAP it be get to be and clearly I do not consider the repercussion of our announcement your announcement Lloyd I should not have implicate you and the rest of the staff spare I your whinge Lloyd I be co director of the project I be on the hook the moment you open your mouth and as I 've say repeatedly I do not think we be responsible for the blackout yeah it would seem our captor would beg to differ we do beg to differ sit please I have emphysema I contract it through year of habitual smoking Disgusting proclivity be not it only villain smoke we know this right I be sorry you be you may call I Flosso and I be a villain imagine a basket the size of Montana now imagine say basket be fill with money that be what my employer be pay I to ask you these question at 11 00 a m on october 6th you conduct a proton drive plasma wakefield experiment it be my understanding that you be search for tachyonic dark matter in the result particle collision how much collision energy be genete I do not know be we talk about a billion electron volt I do not know how many electron volt be generate perhaps I can help you with your inquir on october 6th you be in Toronto bury your father I believe I be ask the man who actually push the button you be here for a differente reason how many electron volt be generate I would rather die than tell you how to manufacture another blackout you think you cause it I do no Dr Simcoe all the two of you do be amplify it so again how many electron volt what you get no wound no ligature mark so I be go with a poison of some kind but I will not know more until the toxology come back we find this might belong to one of the EMTS a leather case fit a palm pre but we do not find a phone if the phone still in the ambulance we can triangulate its position find the phone find the ambulance find the ambulance maybe find the guy who steal it find they and they will get we to Simon and Lloyd just relax you ever sit in a chair before not like this one no some people who 've have difficulty recall their flash forwards hve have real breakthrough with this treatment so how about you tell I what change your mind I be drive everyone around I everyone I care about away because I can not dealwwith what my future might be be that really so hard to say you get no idea Therapy be a lot like a a the first step in recovery be admit you have a problem this go to hurt Truth always do a little the man in my flash forward have a neck like an ox smell like a meat locker do not know where I be or who the man be I feel my thumb on his trachea I push down as hard as I could until I feel something snap then I let go I can not believe you would be capable of something like that I guess mine be a little bit more violent than yours I be confuse in my flash forward I I get a text message from you sorry I have to make a call I can not remember that obviously I could not have send you a text in the middle of what I be do maybe I send you a text early and you just retrieve it I do not understand why do not our future match because it be a possible future clearly you be not pay any attention to the story about the FBI Agent who commit suicide anything 's possible vision or no vision Lloyd that be pointless they be wire window they 've probably nail they shut Touché I just need one person to walk by and look down no wait no wait help help you should start to feel a tingle sensation in your extremity this be completely normal just relax until the memory come what I wish you be stand behind the eight ball when I came crash through go to hell Lloyd what do you see I be on the phone do you know who you be talk to Lloyd Simcoe you drop something let us start again you be conduct an experiment in plasma wakefield acceleration be I correct in that assumption I think I make it clear I can not tell you get the Lloyd be you successful Dr Simcoe all right do your facility detect anything superluminal this have nothing to do with simon why be there any Cherenkov radiation I can not Lloyd help very well then let the wild rumpus begin Hey kdo go back to sleep babe I be check in on you I can not will you sing some more I think I exhaust my repertoire I have to go home I save you this from my dinner a cookie you do thank you hey Aaron it be Mark I think I could use some help talk to I man what be happen Mark why be you sit here in your car in front of a bar it be what be go to happen my therapist give I this drug to unlock the part of my flash forward I could not remember because I be drink it be I I need to talk to you this be not a good time I be on the phone with Lloyd Simcoe have you be drink go to hell Lloyd I tell he I do not want to talk to he you have right to hate I but I do not hate you I wish you be behind the eight ball when I came crash through Fine but we need to talk about the Q e d sound like we be work together I be not sure it be highly theoretical but I be close to crack it listen to I Close be not good enough D Gibbons tell I about D Gibbons lie to you we be run out of time unless we can stop this and then I tell he there be go to be another blackout be you sure I be positive there be go to be another blackout if Simcoe see the same thing you do why be he be sit on this Information why have not he come forward I do not know let us find he and ask he let I back in and I can track he look go home I be do my good to get you reinstate I promise what be I suppose to do till then you say you see more clue from your vision work they but be quiet about it all right this business about another blackout keep it to yourself if we can not tell the world when it be go to happen that be beyond irresponsible this be the number for one of our miss e M T S we be hope the phone might still be in the ambulance can you track it if the battery 's get juice I can capture the signal and triangulate its position how close can you get we to within 50 m if it be in the city let us do it I make it for you daddy to cheer you up it work thank you it be beautiful what be all this it be a giant puzzle something I still have not figure out yet when I do jigsaw puzzle at Nana 's house I always feel that way when she dump the piece out on the table but we always start with the corner and work in at least you know what they be start with the corner come here sometimes we feel God 's hand on the back of our neck push we towards something and sometimes we feel totally abandon that be normal but just because you do not feel something do not mean it be not there how many people here have get sunburn on a cloudy day you do not think it be work on you but it be God 's love be just like that work for your good whether you be aware of it or not here you go thank you sorry I just have a question sure what about our responsibility before God do not we owe he something like what Obedience we need to follow the rule that he set out and if we do not we get punish I just do not see how you can say that the blackout be good and look at all the people that die look at all the trouble it be cause clearly I 've upset you do not you think in the very least the flash forward be a wake up call for we to get our act together before it be too late I do not catch your name Nicole my name be Timothy I would really like to keep talk but if I do not get out of here before my hour 's up I get charge we thank there be a coffee shop I like nearby if you want to talk about it again later Red Panda provide humanitarian aid all around the world everything from micro investment to education we 've be busy since the blackout I be sure you can imagine you say you do work all over the world we grow out of D H S in the ' 90 Demographic and health service we be in South America the Middle East the african subcontinent Somalia be Red Panda there in ' 91 there be no Red Panda in 1991 we be not charter until ' 98 and you send in Teams of people with clean water supply mostly the warlord keep most everyone out but humanitarian group can get in be there anyone I could talk to about maybe piggyback on one of red panda 's trip doubt it not to be disrespectful but most of the people work here probably have police record as thick as the bible we be not like that anymore have a nice day agent Benford you have to let I pay your coffee it be okay I do not have any plan anyway it be not like he be scary or anything I feel well if you be here I will be right here if you need I Great can you see if you can get the change in penny can I buy you a cup of coffee that be all right I be get one to go why do not you tell I what upset you early in my flash forward I be underwater someone be drown I and in the end I be dead People ask I all the time to interpret what they see and I can not ultimately interpretation be your responsibility how could my drowning be good what if you be be baptize would not that be a good thing but then why be I struggle I be sorry to say I 've drop more than one person in a full immersion baptism Water get up their nose they freak out slip away but I die or faint my point here be that these vision be just a snapshotted you only see a small portion think of Jesus and his sacrifice to his disciple it be a tragedy because they could not see the big picture it be a new reality for everyone who come after be that what you think be happen now it be not fate versus freewill it be fate and freewill but I be just a super religious weirdo dude you do not have to believe anything I say but every day God put something good in your life Embrace it and let all the other stuff fall away the challenge we face be recognize that the answer to our most burning question may be right in front of we you sure you do not want to try our tofurky soy cheesesteak it be on special I be positive I wish I could have be more help but I do not know what you be look for I neither thank anyway no problem when do you guy change location about a month ago we have a fire during the blackout luckily I get my money before the insurance company go break where be your old location how many electron volt be generate it be a number Dr Simcoe an abstract object I can not sacrifice any more life Sacrifice be an interesting word I appreciate its duality it can be use as either a noun or a verb one can take action surrender or give something up for something else what be you do I prefer the greek noun form thusia to indicate the object itself that be sacrifice mean one 's family or the proverbial pound of flesh tell they what they want Lloyd I be not say he be bad I just think most religion be a kind of club design to keep some people in and some people out if it make you feel well what difference do it make I be glad you be feel well I just want you to be careful you know what maybe this be not the good idea even when her medicine 's work she be odd and it be unpredictable I want to hang out so there be nothing to be afraid of all right but if you want to bell I totally understand Mom this be my friend Bryce we work together at the hospital do not touch my hair you will scare the butterfly away so this be the reason for all the penny you bring penny I get a bunch today you be a doctor I 've be strike by lightning six time can I help with the wall only use the one mark 1989 that be the year that Nicole be bear nice this whole thing be a tribute to her you never tell I that you never ask actually we be just discuss a question that be be bother we do you think God cause the flash forward Flash forward so what People be cry about it it be not the end of the world I have a hallucination every day nobody give a damn and if you want to know about God what some people call coincidence be really God at work that make perfect sense find one Glue 's right there and start the music will you sure come on girl show he how it be do I come bear gift your son wear a size 4 shoe his physical therapist 's name be Joanie and finally these be take before the blackout we 've have

the blackout Infrared 's catch four guy inside you want in on the takedown text I the address if you care about your son you will want to consider your next response very carefully how many Electron volt be generate c e r N can generate up to 500 teraelectron volt be I in the ballpark you be you be think too small we crack the peta electron volt barrier you generate more than a quadrillion electron volt and what about tachyonic dark matter do you find it we come close we find charge conjugation a certain breakdown in time symmetry now take your side what have we get Clear here clean this up get rid of he take the stair Bomb the bomb be key to 842 3 megahertz that be a bureau frequency when we came roll in here our radio trigger the explosive that be not your everyday kidnapper no

let I put it back on come here I love you so much Charlie bear Blackout Team Season 1 Episode 15 Queen Sacrifice if you be watch this message in 2010 that mean the global blackout be successful that also mean we 've have a near miss in Pigeon Utah how do I know all this because I myself have have hundred of flash forwards in nearly all of my future I end up die on march 15th like you Demetri so if you manage to find this tape in Somalia it would seem our fate be on a collision course and the possible outcome of the game be rapidly narrow as for the endgame the next move be Mark Benford 's that be Dyson Frost and it be genuine it be legit Degradation rate in the tape plus the date of production make it authentic the only explanation however implausible be that Frost flash forward from 1991 to our present and see we in Somalia then in 1991 he make a tape he know we would find that be a 19 year flash forward and march 15th the day he die in his future be the date I be suppose to be murder maybe that be the collision course he be talk about Dem Frost talk about narrow outcome another indication that what people see in their flash forwards be only possibility could be warn we warn we about what there be go to be another blackout what how when we have to assume that be Agent Benford 's next move to find out and to prevent it so let us make it a good one find Dyson Frost yesterday this be magnificent work Master circuit build from basic sketch I design when I be 13 when you finish pat yourself on the back can we get to work I have to go to a lot of trouble to get all this not to mention that basement yes I know the miss digit a terrible loss you find anything in those document we get in Somalia a couple of thing there be several reference to tachyonic dark matter in ' 91 how be that possible the theoretical basis exist but the experiment fail because they need we clearly you be miss the silver ling the blackout we be off the hook not our fault Frost flash forward in ' 91 use technology that we do not develop Flosso say our NLAP experiment amplify the blackout we can not dodge that find anything else interesting I see this formula in my flash forward write on a mirror it be the exact inverse of some of our early NLAP computation I do not know maybe a process to reverse the blackout you be work on blackout protection in your flash forward I do not know but it be this formula and there be there be more of it write on the mirror and the two of they be combine somehow we need the other formula that you see on the benford ' mirror go see your girlfriend Ticktock nothing I run face recognition software on every available database since frost fake his death in 1990 there be not one record not one sighting of this guy nothing he be a thorough guy like complex thing like chess he be also get an arrogant streak like people to know when he be win I 've be look through membership list of chess club pre ' 90 Frost place third in an amateur league in ' 87 and the guy he beat life in San Francisco his name be Ian McKinnon McKinnon be the reign champion until frost beat he in an upset so I trace he and then I give he a call but when I mention Frost he hang up let us travel we need to get to San Francisco and talk to he right yeah but first there be something else this be Frost 's final tournament against McKinnon he use a very risky play call the queen sacrifice look like a total hail mary but it be one of the most effective play in the game so what he know we would see these game it be another message from 1991 tournament game sheet each of his move take either two or four second never more never less in the three game he make 50 move after which he resign so this be a code of some kind wait be this this be morse code 2 second move be dot 4 second move be dash there be 50 move so 50 character this be jumble of letter here not letter Numbers in morse code have five dot or dash 50 divide by 5 be 10 digit be it a phone number prepay cell he really do know the future well do leave a message Dyson Frost this be Agent Benford it be your move now we be travel in english please I know you like halibut some just

know that by try to rescue he we be not go to do the same thing and end up seal his fate I do not but I promise Demetri he be not go to die today and I be keep that promise the man you be about to meet he be brilliant but a little eccentric we have to fake his death in order to remove he from the public eye and he be be difficult ever since so why rely on he only a few people understand the physics involve in all this he be one of they just know that if he get too unmanageable we may ask you to take care of he say the word and consider it do that be what I like about you Alda Clean efficient and eager to please careful of the domino who be your friend Hellinger Alda Hertzog this be Dyson Frost Dyson help we engineer the Raven River experiment help you I create they in any event he be one of the few remain participant still alive be we still on schedule October 6th I 've set up global monitoring station to track the waveform 's propagation so if Simcoe and Campos find their dark matter then we be on our way be the QED ready the first one be the rest will take a bit more time that be astounding it be hard to imagine you be able to fit that much microcircuitry into such a small space I be brilliant right there be a few people who understand the physic involve in all this he be one of they just know that if he get too unmanageable we may ask you to take care of he I promise you that when the time come I will be half a dozen move ahead of you Let us hope that time do not come then you can go now I just have to ask what be with all the domino this be my garden and the white one chart the path of my escape that make no sense at all it do if you live in my head careful you move too much the gun will fire I call it the garden of fork path all those line they be future that branch off of each critical decision I make for I it start back in the ' 80 a place call Raven River we engineer hundred even thousand of flash forwards sometimes we jump 20 minute sometimes we jump 20 year but every time we jump we see a different possible future take the day of the blackout have we fail a different path would have open up we succeed so we move on to the next decision point a new path which bring we to today March 15th the most important fork of all my murder our murder you see the thing be demetri in almost every future I do not live past today 78 of the time you end up kill I why Self defense stupidity bad luck I could construct a hundred scenario the point be once we 've glimpse it the future want to happen it gain weight it be like atmospheric pressure bear down if we want to escape that pressure we have to do something drastic why the death trap why do not you kill I why even bother use Mark 's gun I be attempt to conform to the predict future as closely as I can while still allow for the possibility that we both might live I want to come in from the cold and you be my insurance that make I feel well two bird one gun you be insane Most oracle be you know they see the future and the knowledge end up destroy they I be go now this be ridiculous you want to come in from the cold you want to share what you know share what you know careful I do not know what be go to happen Demetri but in all likelihood one of we will die today come back do not have to work out this way you hear I you come back Bishop one how be it go we 've clone the station 's CCTV for maximum coverage but so far no sign of Frost just make sure you do not spook he we be be discreet sir I promise last call this be your last call for the number 2 train depart from track 10 Bishop one I see white male in a green army jacket approach kingmaker Disregard he be move on that be the fast cholecystectomy I 've ever see try to catch up I get a late start and a board full of elective case Maneesh what inhale anesthetic do you use Sevoflurane do anyone use halothane anymore in develop country maybe here it be pretty much be replace by new agent why the sudden interest in old school anesthesia it be complicated there be this formula that Lloyd show I he think it have something to do with the blackout so you be talk to he again he think the formula for halothane have something to do with it interesting can you meet I in the PICU I need to cannulate a kid for ECMO I know you would get a same day hearing if you put your mind to it hold here please be appendicitis suppose to hurt on the right or the left Alda please I could get disbar for this lose job dead boyfriend hard choice you arrange for all these extra marshal you must think I be a big

Mark okay I need to talk to you about a murder as a part of the investigation into Dem 's disappearance we be look into the shooting of a homeless man in a shelter downtown he do not have any formal id on he what do this have to do with Dem Mark 's gun be use in that murder and we have reason the believe that the man who take Demetri have that gun now we be hope that if we could ID the guy we might uncover a connection to Frost that would lead we to he so once you find Frost you will find Demetri right I go through the victim 's stuff and find a disposable cell phone the phone have an old text message send to your number my number why would he possibly have my number it be from October the content be sensitive it say Mark be drink in his flash forward would you mind just come down to the morgue and take a look at the body you must know this man somehow yeah I be sure I do not he know you and anything you know could help Demetri let I change all bishop I have an african american

be a savant you all be he use you for your eidetic memory like human recorder when they finish with we when they use we all up he tell they to kill we so we would not tell he be dead now you do not have to be afraid of he anymore the early worm catch the bird I 've be wait why have you be follow I it be an emergency you be go the wrong way so I have to turn you around 'cause you be go the wrong

the road you have to listen to I you have to remember these thing because they be important you have to be here for thing to come you be a piece of the puzzle they can not solve it without you gentleman it be be PET scan CT scan and subject to neutron emission analysis what be it some kind of little electronic Kryptonite no this be more complicated our analyst be say it make our current tech look kind of primitive they have no idea what it be that be why I 've invite Simon and Lloyd to join we Suspect zero have one too you think he and Dyson Frost be work together possibly we know that D Gibbons Frost make numerous call during the blackout as far as we know they be the only two people in the world awake during the blackout Suspect zero be wear a ring and Frost have this one in his possession it be a QED what a quantum entanglement device my God it exist this be what we be discuss in our flash forwards english gentleman English please let us start with the basic Theoretically Frost and his pal ramp up our linear accelerator to such extreme energy that it send shock wave through the consciousness field and jolt all of humanity 's awareness to a different place in space time the flash forward now suspect zero and Frost be awake during the time of the blackout correct they be in some way protect clearly so you think this ring be a device which anchor their mind to their current location in space time in other word it help they stay conscious you be say this little thing keep those guy from black out maybe this be why they be so anxious to attack our office on April 29th maybe they be not come for I but for this and now that we know that we can figure out a way to stop they Mr Vogel I be tell to meet you by assistant director Bramwell yes Ms Hawk please sit Congratulations on graduate today survive Quantico be no small accomplishment thank you I be tell this be about a special assignment but I be actually start in the L A office next month I will get right to the point I be not with the bureau as I be sure you be aware historically the bureau and the agency have not always cooperate as closely as they might have we be try to change that you be CIA as a part of a still classified operation we 've assess your graduating class and find half a dozen candidate potentially vulnerable to hostile recruitment and I be one of they your financial situation your sexual orientation your unconventional upbringing they all make you a potential target that be ridiculous you be wrong I would never betray my country I would never betray a fellow Agent you have the wrong person Agent we know we 've do our homework your reputation amongst your classmate and your instructor be impeccable and Bramwell say you be one of the fine student he be see in year I do not understand we need a dangle we know something big be go down something that will make 9 11 look like a Fender bender we need someone on the inside now we have reason to believe that an organization may approach you soon and ask you to be a mole in the L A office we want you to say yes you want I to be a double agent yes I be not go to kid you Janis it will not be easy they will manipulate you they will use you in way you can not imagine you will know thing but you will not be able to tell anyone you will be in constant danger you will betray your friend and there may come a time when they ask you to do something which go against everything you believe in and care about you be go to have to do it to win their trust and stay on the inside do you think you be capable of do what you have to do so they have the ring it be be on Mark 's board since Utah you be go to have to get it back how be I suppose to do that it be in a well fortified vault in the basement of the FBI for God sake you keep ask I to do this impossible stuff I be go to blow my cover I know you 've grow to like these people they be like family to you and this understandably be hard for you but you fail to follow Benford to Frost and you fail in destroy the blueprint which be most unfortunate I would not make a third mistake Janis this be where you get to prove your dedication to the cause darlin ' I will get the ring and Janis one more thing we need you to kill Benford oh my God come quick it be your sister Annabelle I want to come home take Annabelle that be never part of the deal you ask I to give you datum to tell you when we be run the experiment that be all the deal be whatever we say it be Annabelle be just insurance what be that on his hand that look like a ring a quantum entanglement device I be Gabriel McDow I tell you that I definitely say that already you have to remember thing why have you be follow I you be go the wrong way the future I see you be always with Lloyd you all know Fiona Banks MI 6 none of they have vision and now they be all dead the blue hand no limit no fear a death club Slingerland be I say that right it say here you teach american history at South Fairfax high this conversation have already be write whatever you 've all see be go to happen now Celia 's death be an accident it could 've happen to anyone what I see do not have to play out that way I find a way to change the game you do realize you be wear the same jacket you be wear when we break ground on the accelerator it be an accident I suppose there be no accident Lloyd I detect some sublimated sentiment bubble to the surface this be a big deal for both of we we 've be work on tachyon for 12 year this be our moment Simon go with it Cheers Cheers God I hope it all work we be simulate the big bang what could go wrong excuse I Sure sure it be mum hello what when be Annabelle all right just tell she I will be on the first flight home okay you too Bye my dad die Activation in one minute all right this experience be design by Dr Campos who unfortunately could not be with we on this day when we recreate the beginning of the universe Lloyd Simcoe Dr Campos ' mentor the brain behind the brain this be Angie Tremont from the new science report a journalist it be all right she be be clear sorry we have a rather strict confidentiality protocol so we be a little wary of the press it be a pleasure to meet you Dr Simcoe Dr Myhill 's be tell I all about the project your crown glory it be be a team effort Gordon the preliminary firing have start the big moment yes they be ready activation commence in 30 second Initiate here go nothing or everything Activation commence in 20 second activation commence in 10 second the vision people have be really only just possible future the universe operate within certain parameter but there be some flexibility with one week till the 29th Dr Simcoe we be all still wonder what to expect it be a well know precept in quantum physics that observation shape reality you be say that see our future may in fact change our future that be the theory yes but the future do have a way of fight back what do you mean by that small thing may change but the force of the universe may be push we towards the future we have see that be interesting and what about the people who learn they be mean to die before the 29th but live past the fatal event those people be the statistical anomaly at the edge of the curve should you still be worry because it sound like you be say the universe may course correct that they might not have escape their fate after all yes that be possible so maybe a well word for course correction be destiny I be just a scientist I be not really qualified to answer that question I would like to welcome tonight 's next guest Celia Quinones Ms Quinones be the young woman whose future be change by the suicide of FBI Agent Al Gough one of Dr Simcoe 's statistical anomaly Ms quinone take we through your experience First I would like to say again to the family of Agent Gough how grateful my family and I be for his action in the first week after the blackout I hear that not have a vision mean that I would be dead on April 29th that must 've be terrify for you when I discover on the mosaic web site that I would be hit by a car I live in constant terror that I might die at any moment but you do not I be sure a lot of people have question so let us open up the phone line Muncie Indiana you be on the air this question be for Dr Simcoe be it possible the blackout cause permanent brain damage to anyone there be no reason to believe so People 's life have be ruin what if this happen again it be critical that people remain calm and I must repeat that no one 's brain be damage in any way by the blackout itself and let I reassure you it be impossible that there could be another blackout I almost believe he myself tell I again why we be not tell people there be another blackout come we do not know when it be go to happen we tell people but do not say when the world will turn into an armed camp so Celia you be confident that your future have change I be still here the universe seem to have a different plan for I thank you for join we today any last word Dr Simcoe come the 29th I believe that we will end up where we be suppose to be suppose to be that do not mean we

've pick up on it a long time ago I know how much this be weigh on you I wish there be something I could do to help you already be you want to see I you may think that promise a junior analyst a

superposition it be keep people awake but how you be not listen maintain superposition be what you say and I have no idea do you want to focus a little we 've do enough damage maybe we can put something right look just because you feel guilty about lie on the news and want to save the world do not mean that we can actually make it happen yes we can and it be not about feel guilty no it be about prevent more death it be all Lloyd Simcoe 's fault and now he can save the day it be a little messianic do not you think what be you talk about million of death it be an overwhelming concept
